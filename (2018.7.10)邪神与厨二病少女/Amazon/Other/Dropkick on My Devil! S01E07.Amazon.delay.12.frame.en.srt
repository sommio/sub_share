1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:05,109
Won't leave

2
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:10,823
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,038
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,011
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,597
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:36,432
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:40,186
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,021
If you go too far

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,067
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,403
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,490
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,786
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:00,873
I'll never give up

14
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:06,713
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,632
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:13,052
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:18,141
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,352
But until then

20
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:27,317
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,077
Wish I could stop by the arcade.

22
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:41,873
The new mango figure
was just released.

23
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:45,001
But since I bought
refrigerated groceries,

24
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,461
I really can't.

25
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:50,381
-Poor me. I want a mango figure.
-Here she comes.

26
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,718
Since it's the perfect weather...

27
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:04,437
Over here!

28
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,357
What do you think
of my Light Sword?

29
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,566
Sword?

30
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,902
This is payback for last time.

31
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,071
-Potato!
-Potato?

32
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:15,531
Hey! I'm Jashin-chan, not Potato!

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,950
Who the hell are you anyway?

34
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:23,081
I'm Poporon, the angel you threw
over the cliff and into the ocean.

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,131
I can't recall...

36
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,717
How could you forget?

37
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,348
That's Yurine's Polar Bear almond jelly!
How could you?

38
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:43,559
Not my problem.
Are you even listening to me?

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,562
This is bad. This is really bad.

40
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:50,108
Grocery shopping isn't that hard.

41
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,821
It hurts!

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,619
Damn it! First you spill my curry
and now my almond jelly?

43
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,579
-Not my problem.
-Damn you!

44
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,501
If I knew this was gonna happen,
I would've just gone to the arcade!

45
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,879
-I would've gotten that mango!
-As an angel,

46
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,090
I can't allow myself lose to a devil.

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,926
My mango. My precious mango...

48
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,219
Listen to me!

49
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:23,766
You devils are painful to look at!
A worthless, inferior species!

50
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,101
Get out of my sight!

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,602
Nope.

52
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:28,396
-Do it!
-Nope.

53
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,648
I refuse to obey you.

54
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:33,860
I've had it! Now you're going to die!

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,658
Impressed? I trained to stop swords
with my bare hands, just in case.

56
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,619
But why? You're okay...?

57
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:45,121
That thorn got you...

58
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,290
That hurts!

59
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,833
Such an idiot.

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,962
You treat devils like shit
because you think you're superior?

61
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,256
You don't deserve
to be an angel!

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,477
What's happening?
I feel so much energy!

63
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,522
Now that I've absorbed angel powers,

64
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,817
I'm Super Jashin-chan,
a fusion of justice and evil!

65
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,819
The halo had that kind of power?

66
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,198
Just kidding.

67
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,658
It only lit up for a second.

68
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,410
How disappointing.

69
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:28,080
Without my halo,
I can't use my powers!

70
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,790
Victory!

71
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,460
So, what was that about the Light Sword?

72
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:36,047
Without your powers,
that's just a thorny bat.

73
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,216
What are you gonna do, huh?

74
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:42,887
I guess it's our time, the devils,
the inferior species, to shine!

75
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,347
How exciting!

76
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,557
Here I go!

77
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:50,686
You better brace yourself!

78
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,732
Why so serious?
Come on, it was all a joke.

79
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,318
Angels and devils,
we should all be friends!

80
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,612
Say no to Armageddon!

81
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,280
See you later!

82
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,200
Pretty devious for an angel.

83
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:07,787
-She reminds me of someone.
-Her!

84
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:08,996
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,040
The Polar Bear almond jelly...

86
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,794
She'll be furious.

87
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,339
The perfect weapon for an angel.

88
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,931
Medusa showed me a great curry shop
the other day called Manten.

89
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,433
Their portions are huge. It's really good too.

90
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:34,230
Yurine made me replace the poisoned cake
I was gonna give Minos.

91
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,066
Oh, so where's Medusa?

92
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:40,486
-She's out with some friend.
-Friend?

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,238
What's wrong?

94
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:44,574
Medusa has a friend?

95
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,410
Besides me?

96
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,704
ATM.

97
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,831
I'M TOO BUSY FOR YOU,
AT THE MOMENT.

98
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,916
That traitor!

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:58,671
-Hey Jashin-chan. You there?
-Who is this other friend, anyway?

100
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,590
Are you really gonna eat that?

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,469
Damn it! I'm gonna call her
and make her come here!

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,973
Daimaruyaki!

103
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,518
Gotta split, it's time for my shift.

104
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,526
You cunning bitch!
Who the hell are you seeing?

105
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:24,071
Who are you seeing besides me?

106
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:25,990
Seriously?

107
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,618
How did you know?

108
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:29,910
So, it's true?

109
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:33,873
You whore!
Now you show your true colors!

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,791
-Are you jealous?
-What?

111
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,961
Medusa's free
to have other friends.

112
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,547
Jealous? Not at all.

113
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,759
I'm fine. I'm not bothered at all.

114
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,136
But, I just can't seem
to forgive her.

115
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,221
That's called jealously, my friend.

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,473
Now spill it!

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,933
Who were you with,
you backstabber?

118
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,560
Well...

119
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,483
So, now you're feeling guilty
and can't find the words to say?

120
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:06,030
-You always said you loved me! Jeez!
-I'll be at the bookstore.

121
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,573
Not so fast!

122
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,369
You better listen to what
this bitch has to say!

123
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,537
Shut up.

124
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,247
You're so mean.

125
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,501
Why do you keep calling me a bitch
and a backstabber?

126
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,711
Crying's not gonna help.

127
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:24,090
Just give me an explanation.

128
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:28,260
I thought I had to keep it to myself.

129
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,389
-What?
-You told me not to tell.

130
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,932
A few days ago...

131
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:39,271
I spent 5000 yen in an attempt
to get a prize at the arcade...

132
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,318
And all I got was a grape figure!
What a damn waste!

133
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,822
That's why I'm so worked up right now.

134
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,908
I used up all my allowance.

135
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:55,162
Medusa, do you love me?

136
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:59,458
What's the matter?
Of course I love you, Jashin-chan.

137
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:05,923
How will I survive when I'm so broke?
What am I supposed to do?

138
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,550
Don't cry!

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,011
-Don't worry, I'll work more.
-Really?

140
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,097
I'll take care of you.

141
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:15,808
Really? That's so nice of you.

142
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:20,229
-I wasn't expecting anything.
-It's okay.

143
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:25,109
But don't say you're doing this for me,
that'll make me look bad.

144
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,444
I won't, I promise.

145
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:31,240
I lied to Minos to keep our secret.

146
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,869
But you put me on the spot
in front of Yurine...

147
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:40,833
You kept calling me a bitch
and accused me of being guilty.

148
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,003
Yurine, we'll meet you
at the bookstore.

149
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:45,629
Too late, huh?

150
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,301
Sorry about the name-calling.
So, who called you a bitch?

151
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,638
Come on, tell me.
I'll go beat them up.

152
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,100
-You're the worst!
-Jashin-chan.

153
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,520
You really are the worst
of the worst.

154
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,148
I actually feel bad for you.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,651
Even for a devil, you're pretty low.

156
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:11,697
You're not going to do anything to me?

157
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,784
Medusa, I'll walk you to the station.

158
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,078
Munch.

159
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:23,334
What is this feeling?

160
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:27,213
That defeated look on Yurine's face...

161
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,176
She's basically saying I'm so worthless
I don't even deserve to be punished.

162
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:40,100
My stomach's upset.

163
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,312
I can't take this humiliation!

164
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,651
Are you crying?

165
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,152
I am.

166
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:51,862
So you're puking.

167
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,989
Clean up after yourself.

168
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,387
Hello.

169
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,682
Hey!

170
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,267
Minos.

171
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:24,353
There's a message from Jashin-chan.

172
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,897
It's for you, Medusa.

173
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,149
Thank you for waiting.

174
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:33,779
Looking back at yesterday,

175
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:38,576
I think I may have been at fault,
just a tiny bit.

176
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:43,747
To make up for it,
I'll give you my full attention today.

177
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:45,708
Meet me in Shibuya at 1.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,501
See you there.

179
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,087
Jashin-chan...

180
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:54,717
Since she's broke,
she caused a ruckus in front of my place

181
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,469
but I didn't notice because I was asleep.

182
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,930
She left that note in my mailbox.

183
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,434
It's okay!
That's why I'm working more.

184
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,229
I support Jashin-chan
when she's in need! See you!

185
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,647
Hey, the curry!

186
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,358
Sorry, could you eat it for me? Thanks!

187
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,110
I'll leave the money here!

188
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,487
-Thank you.
-Sweet!

189
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll wear that thing I bought last time!

190
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,743
I'm gonna surprise her!

191
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,371
Weren't you going out?

192
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,750
I'm headed out soon.
We're meeting at 1.

193
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,710
Must be one on the dot.

194
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:30,961
Yeah, it is.

195
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,464
That jingle!

196
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:37,301
Congratulations, Jashin-chan.
You've reached the next level.

197
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:39,470
What's that?

198
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,098
She's Tangan-chan.
A low-class messenger devil.

199
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,308
I see.

200
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:49,396
Since you've reached the next level,
you've earned a reward.

201
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,148
All right!

202
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:53,567
What's gonna happen now?

203
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:58,489
-I get a bunch of perks too.
-Perks?

204
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:02,242
Let's see, free train passes,
luxury hotel vouchers...

205
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:07,873
I also get generous supermarket coupons,
and a whole lot more!

206
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,417
Are you a stockholder or something?

207
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:15,631
Hey, but I never killed anything
to advance to the next level.

208
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:20,386
The other day, you stripped an angel
of her powers by eating her halo.

209
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,888
That qualified you for advancement.

210
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:26,058
Awesome!
I better eat more halos then!

211
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,937
Since you can't go back home to hell,

212
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:34,066
Mr. Satan sent you this as a reward.

213
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,110
What's that?

214
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,570
Long story short,

215
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:41,532
that's a by-product
of Mr. Satan's research

216
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,576
-into black magic.
-It's a long story. Snack time.

217
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:48,080
He used a secret method to produce

218
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:51,041
this super uber exciting
cosmic concoction

219
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,043
that does wonders for your body.

220
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:54,962
That's all.

221
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,508
-This is the ultimate energy drink.
-Correct.

222
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,428
Maybe I could kill Yurine now.

223
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,680
My duties are done here.

224
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:07,099
This is goodbye!

225
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,101
She exploded.

226
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:14,690
Tangan-chan self-destructs
when her duties are done.

227
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,358
That's intense.

228
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,820
But when a devil dies
in the human world,

229
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:23,782
they regenerate as a higher class devil
in hell, so it's all good.

230
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:28,662
Cheers to you, Tangan-chan.

231
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,126
That stench!

232
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:37,713
Is this really okay to drink?

233
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,757
JASHIN-CHAN, DRINK UP!
FROM SATAN

234
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:45,304
It's probably not as bad as it smells.

235
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:46,472
Right?

236
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,059
If you're gonna drink it,
do it now. It stinks.

237
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:56,482
That was horrible! Gross!

238
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,276
-Disgusting!
-Unexpectedly bad, huh?

239
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:04,740
Yum, so good.

240
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,828
How dare you eat pudding
while I suffer? Give me a bite!

241
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,291
No way. I keep my dessert
all to myself.

242
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,379
Damn it! I'm gonna get Medusa
to buy me all the sweets I want!

243
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:22,091
What the hell?

244
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:24,051
I tripped over nothing!

245
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,346
Jashin-chan, look at you.

246
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,231
I bet it'll surprise her.

247
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,524
Hey!

248
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:42,236
Jashin-chan? Why are you wearing clothes?

249
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,071
You look so cute!

250
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,199
I'm not cute, I'm strong.

251
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:48,867
Sorry for the wait.

252
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,911
No problem.

253
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:53,163
I got here early.

254
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:58,043
But I think people were starting
to get suspicious after a while.

255
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,839
Jashin-chan, you have legs!

256
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:03,841
You finally noticed.

257
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,051
Look at you.

258
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,096
I grew legs!

259
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,099
-Because of this?
-Must be.

260
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:16,311
Growing legs will make me
more powerful, huh?

261
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,940
You're making the animator's job hard
by being nude.

262
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,608
Here, wear some clothes.

263
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,613
Question. Is this underwear brand new?

264
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,574
Never worn!

265
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:33,912
Medusa's gonna flip out
when she sees me like this.

266
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:37,082
So that's the story.
Is your mind blown?

267
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,378
That's amazing how you got
a reward like that from Mr. Satan!

268
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,881
Hey, where's your paper bag?

269
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,887
I'm wearing contacts
that prevent petrification.

270
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,597
What? That's genius!

271
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,851
Now you can walk around the human world
without a paper bag?

272
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,102
That's right!

273
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,272
I'm happy for you, Medusa.

274
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,609
Hey, Jashin-chan.

275
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:08,739
I wanna wear clothes like you.
Help me pick something out.

276
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:18,624
This one's cute.

277
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,751
They all look the same to me.

278
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,711
How's this?

279
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,713
Looks good on you.

280
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,757
Really? Thanks.

281
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,761
It feels so refreshing
to not have to wear a bag around town.

282
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,681
This is a whole new world for me,
it's so fun.

283
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,312
Medusa's having the time of her life.
She must have dreaded wearing the bag.

284
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:46,026
Aren't you happy you grew legs too?
You seem to like them a lot.

285
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:49,780
It's not that exciting.
I'm still getting used to them.

286
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:50,989
Look.

287
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,033
Angels in Shibuya.

288
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,119
Hey, lovely angels,
wanna go out with us?

289
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:57,371
We're devils!

290
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,248
-We got asked out.
-Help!

291
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:02,501
Losers.
They don't even know who we are.

292
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,723
-This is so cool. And yummy.
-I don't get humans. Is this cute?

293
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,269
Let's go see that later.

294
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,688
What's that? It's huge.

295
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,356
It's a unicorn!

296
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:29,069
Jashin-chan is here in Tokyo somewhere.

297
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,170
Jashin-chan, it's the ocean!

298
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,256
Are you okay?

299
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,424
Need help?

300
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,633
Hands off!

301
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:53,760
Scram, you fools!

302
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,597
-I'm still not used to these shoes.
-Are you okay?

303
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,142
Medusa, your legs!

304
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,353
What's happening...?

305
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,397
They're petrifying!

306
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:09,401
Let's move away from all the people.
Over there!

307
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,031
Could it be a side effect
from using those contact lenses?

308
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:16,992
Take them out for a second.

309
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:25,500
-The petrification is stopping.
-I knew it.

310
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,212
Petrification isn't that easy to prevent.

311
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:32,132
You got ripped off
by these cheap bastards.

312
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:35,010
I'll give them hell when I get back!

313
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm sorry, Jashin-chan.

314
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,431
I just wanted us
to have a good time.

315
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,687
Instead I've upset you
and now I'm back to wearing the bag.

316
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:47,522
Don't cry, Medusa!

317
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:48,940
It's not...

318
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,527
It's not a nuisance for me at all.

319
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:56,490
Plus, there might be another way
to prevent the petrification.

320
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,200
Let's not give up.

321
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:01,661
You're right.

322
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,916
But that company's going down!
I'll never forgive them!

323
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,628
How could they sell
such cheap product?

324
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,468
What? Where am I?

325
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,847
-I bought them from you.
-Thanks for your business!

326
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:25,560
You're the corrupt seller
of these contact lenses?

327
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:29,189
Dropkick in Odaiba!

328
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:32,150
You brats!

329
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:35,320
My dropkick is even more destructive!

330
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,240
It might be powerful enough
to kill Yurine.

331
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:39,991
Thanks!

332
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:42,577
Jashin-chan, you're so kind.

333
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,913
What? Not at all.

334
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,209
That's what he gets
for making you waste your money.

335
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,962
And your money is my money!

336
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,797
Okay, okay.

337
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,969
-We should head home soon.
-Yup.

338
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:02,889
Sorry, but you gotta wear this bag again.

339
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,183
Get on my back.

340
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,146
You can't be walking
with those petrified legs.

341
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:14,109
Thanks, Jashin-chan.
I hope I'm not too heavy.

342
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,236
You are.
You should go on a diet.

343
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:18,113
Meanie...

344
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,867
I just felt something cold.
Did you just drool on me?

345
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:23,618
I did not.

346
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,209
Snow? Well, that's out of season.

347
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,399
What?

348
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,069
You carried Medusa all the way home
from Odaiba?

349
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm pretty beat right now.

350
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,781
Sorry.

351
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,493
So you're not completely hopeless after all.

352
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:05,952
Well, barely.

353
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:09,331
Now that she thinks
there's a glimpse of good in me...

354
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:12,626
My dropkick's deadly
thanks to these legs!

355
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,211
Die, Yurine!

356
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,506
This is gonna be the final episode!

357
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,216
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

358
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:22,928
The final one before we start airing
the series of highlights

359
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:26,723
that was obviously put together
in a rush to make the deadline!

360
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,106
What? My tail's back.

361
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:38,360
I guess it only lasts
for a fixed period of time.

362
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:41,112
Boy, that's a bummer.

363
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:44,449
But I feel like myself again!

364
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,536
-I'll go make dinner now.
-Not so fast.

365
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,831
I was actually a little proud of you earlier

366
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,376
but you had to ruin it, didn't you?

367
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,962
You tried to kill me again.

368
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,631
Now that your tail's back,

369
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:03,051
why don't we serve live viper
for dinner tonight?

370
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,636
Please don't!

371
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,846
I don't wanna be eaten!

372
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,641
Jashin-chan,
thank you for an amazing day.

373
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,499
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

374
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,421
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

375
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:44,718
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

376
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:49,097
As she starves to death

377
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,600
It's a love and hate relationship

378
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,893
Can't leave each other alone

379
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:58,607
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

380
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:02,819
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

381
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,238
Test my heart, don't stop

382
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:12,287
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

383
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:16,499
We're a happy family

384
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,754
Let me say, I love you

385
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:23,298
When all is said and done

386
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:27,969
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

387
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:32,641
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

388
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,851
For another crazy tomorrow

389
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,563
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

390
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:44,194
Both have had their wings torn off
and have been traumatized.

391
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,698
But they are completely the opposite.
Two completely different angels.

392
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,200
And the devil goes beyond time.

393
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:51,910
Dropkick on My Devil!

394
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,080
We'll paro special into your heart
in the next episode too!

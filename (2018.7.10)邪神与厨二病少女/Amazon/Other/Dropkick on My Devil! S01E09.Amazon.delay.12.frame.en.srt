00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:02,690
JULY 9TH

2
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:07,111
LIFE THEATER

3
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:10,698
I blew it again.

4
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,412
That was my 17,711th attempt!

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,167
Won't leave

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:26,923
Without a dropkick on her

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,012
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

8
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:48,111
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

9
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,571
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,490
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,202
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

12
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,121
If you go too far

13
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:02,083
I'll slice you up completely

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,419
Your halo
Must get it back

15
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:08,548
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

16
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:12,802
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

17
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,931
I'll never give up

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,599
Yurine, you're off your guard!

19
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:22,770
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

20
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:25,690
Huh? What? I missed...

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,110
Can't leave Earth

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,198
Without a dropkick on her

23
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:37,410
But until then

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,333
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

25
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:49,589
Medusa!

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,470
What is it, Jashin-chan?
You look so serious.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,180
-We're going to the bank.
-What?

28
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,391
No, resist that urge! Don't rob the bank!

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,851
Please don't!

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,979
Chill out. We're just withdrawing your money.

31
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,939
Oh, you got me there.

32
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,649
Well, the slots got me.

33
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,361
-I'm so relieved.
-Don't be.

34
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,780
My actions rewrite history.

35
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,199
This is the last time.

36
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:19,369
Now, let's get going to the bank.

37
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:32,840
How the hell did we end up
in the middle of a bank robbery?

38
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,592
Don't make a sound!

39
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,552
Don't get smart with us.

40
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,847
I should have sent you here alone.

41
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,183
I never signed up for this!

42
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:46,646
You! Viper girl, cut the whining or I'll kill you.

43
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:51,109
I don't care what happens to her,
just spare my life, won't you?

44
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:52,527
How could you!

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,571
Another word and you're both dead.

46
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:58,449
Mom, I wanna play cards.

47
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,119
-Quiet, not now.
-This sucks.

48
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:06,791
Jashin-chan, do you think your dropkick
could take these humans out?

49
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,877
You're a devil, you should punish them.

50
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:13,131
But if I miss, they'd kill me.
Why risk my life?

51
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,760
Even devils aren't immune
to a bullet in the head.

52
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:20,430
But you have to protect everyone!

53
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,099
Mom, I'm starving.

54
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,600
Hang in there.

55
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:27,437
I'm supposed to take my meds right now.

56
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,148
I can't let my pet chick starve to death.

57
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:33,317
I can't afford to miss today's business meeting.

58
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,321
I'm missing out on Miyutan's handshake event.

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,198
Guess I'm late for work.

60
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:43,161
-Baby coming...
-I'm going to pee my pants!

61
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,913
Fine, all right.

62
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,457
Jashin-chan!

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,169
If you're so inclined, go for it.

64
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,671
I'll be an innocent bystander who lives.

65
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:58,468
I should look for another gig.

66
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,013
-Baby...
-I need those meds to stay thin.

67
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,140
-This is horrible!
-My poor chick!

68
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:06,142
You're really going for it?

69
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:07,810
Yes.

70
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,481
-Are we done?
-No, not yet.

71
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:14,317
Hey, move again and you're dead.

72
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,986
What's with the paper bag?

73
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,449
Excuse me, would you please
take a look at my eyes?

74
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:25,411
Hey, she's pretty cute!

75
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,209
Well done.

76
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:35,379
Everyone, we're safe now.

77
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:39,300
-What just happened?
-No idea, but we're safe now!

78
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,219
She looks like Miyutan!

79
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,054
-Thank you.
-Paper bag girl!

80
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:44,222
Thanks.

81
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,307
The baby's born, I'm ecstatic.

82
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,060
I couldn't hold it.
It's all lukewarm for me.

83
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:53,731
My dropkick would've been just as effective,
you know.

84
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,901
But I'll let Medusa take all the credit here.

85
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,911
Orochimaru! That was quite a feat!

86
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:10,790
Oh, that was nothing, really.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,210
Couldn't do it without my partner, Medusa.

88
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,671
Hey, paper bag girl.

89
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,048
When will they de-fossilize?

90
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,133
Oh, eventually.

91
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:25,096
-Gotcha! Leave the rest to us!
-Thank you.

92
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,181
Let's go, Orochimaru.

93
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,100
-Where?
-Oh, come on.

94
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,061
I'm gonna make you mine today.

95
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,730
-You're under arrest!
-No way in hell!

96
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:37,692
-Medusa, help!
-Not my problem.

97
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:41,487
Bank robber arrest victory!
Now that's Insta-worthy.

98
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,990
Hashtag "no money stolen."

99
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:46,450
Hashtag "but my heart was."

100
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,452
Hashtag "I love Orochimaru."

101
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:53,082
I need you! ATM!

102
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,377
You're on your own, deceiver.

103
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,713
The ATMs are over there.

104
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:01,299
What? You traitor!

105
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,301
I should've known!

106
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,763
The number of bank robberies
in Japan peaked in 2001.

107
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,141
Since then, they have decreased.

108
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:14,770
Instead, low-risk crimes like bank transfer scams
have sky-rocketed.

109
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:20,192
Don't be a victim.
Check-in with your parents frequently.

110
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,529
But history's changed now!

111
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,741
My bag ripped.

112
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:27,950
Use this.

113
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,703
Thanks, that's good for now.

114
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:36,500
But nothing tops craft paper bags
when it comes to comfort, texture and smell.

115
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,878
Never knew you were so particular.

116
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,720
It's a new day!

117
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:55,686
Time to deliver the milk!

118
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,523
MILK

119
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,526
There! That's it for today.

120
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,947
Sweet. I was a second faster than last time!

121
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:12,078
At this rate, I'll eventually make
a zero-second record!

122
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,829
Oh, I wish!

123
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:17,500
Seconds, please!

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,420
-You've got quite the appetite.
-She's got no shame.

125
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:24,590
You're just a great cook, Jashin-chan.

126
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,219
I know. No need to say it.

127
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,553
Here you go.

128
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:32,098
Just like the folktales.

129
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,391
Like this one.

130
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:36,310
Where does that energy come from?

131
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:39,730
Never caught a cold as a child either.

132
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,692
They do say that fools never catch colds.

133
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,278
I've never caught a cold either.

134
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,988
Because I'm a fool.

135
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,740
Are you okay on time?

136
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,701
Shoot, I'm gonna be late.

137
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,453
Thanks for breakfast! See you!

138
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,539
Minos works so hard.

139
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,208
The complete opposite of someone I know.

140
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm a devoted homemaker.

141
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,257
Here we go.

142
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,592
We're glad to have you here.

143
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,428
You can count on me.

144
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,056
-It's so heavy...
-Hey, little one!

145
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,558
Me?

146
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,769
Yeah, you! Little one! I'm talking to you.

147
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,480
You're moving too slow.
Wake up, will you?

148
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:25,651
Why do I have to be treated like a slave
in order to survive?

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,529
Leave the heavy-lifting to me.

150
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,407
Go get assigned another task.

151
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,200
Thank you so much.

152
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,744
No biggie.

153
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,246
She's so bright.

154
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,999
She is a devil, right?

155
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,713
Another busy day of work all done!

156
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,757
Time to jog back home.

157
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,551
Thanks for--

158
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,726
I couldn't even thank her.
I'm such a loser.

159
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,771
I will next time.

160
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,986
Will I ever get to see Jashin-chan?

161
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:17,036
-My bad! Are you okay?
-Yes.

162
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:20,039
Good, I'm glad.

163
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:23,167
Get home safe.

164
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,919
See you!

165
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,297
She's a devil!

166
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:32,259
Wait, do you know Jashin-chan? Hey!

167
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,013
Hey, Minos!

168
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,058
-Let's play cards!
-Play with us.

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,269
Sorry, kiddos, I don't have my cards with me.

170
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,021
Really?

171
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,272
That's a bummer.

172
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,359
-Next time, I promise!
-Okay, see you!

173
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:50,361
-Bye!
-See you later!

174
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,780
Hey, kiddos...

175
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:58,160
I've got cards we could play with,
what do you say?

176
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,207
No, we're good.

177
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,501
-Let's go, guys.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:09,171
-We wanted Minos.
-She's got big boobs.

179
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:13,050
-Minos is really good, too.
-She's got big boobs, too.

180
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,350
What a day today!

181
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:26,522
Taking a bath after a hard day's work
is the best feeling ever.

182
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:28,566
Yeah!

183
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,532
Delicious!

184
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,201
I'm ready to do it all again tomorrow!

185
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,126
We're both devils, but why is Minos
more popular with humans? Damn it!

186
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,420
You're better off extinct, humans!

187
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,506
With that attitude, it's no surprise.

188
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,551
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

189
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,721
What do you wanna drink?

190
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,432
-Orange or grapefruit?
-Orange.

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
All right.

192
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,106
-Here you go.
-That was kind of gross.

193
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,611
Jashin-chan.

194
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:17,156
How does ramen for lunch sound?

195
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,909
I'm in the mood for rice.

196
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:23,746
You look like you're lusting for ramen.

197
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:24,914
But I just said--

198
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,499
You want ramen, right?

199
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,753
Yes, I'd love to eat ramen.

200
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:33,213
Here we go again.

201
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:35,049
Welcome!

202
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,261
-Hey you!
-Damn it.

203
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,431
-You know her?
-She almost killed me!

204
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,393
-I'll finish you today!
-Please stop, I don't know you!

205
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,520
-You can't fool me!
-Stop!

206
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:51,732
-Don't hurt Noel!
-Step away!

207
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:55,736
What? Noel?
That's not your name.

208
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,491
Noel is a future idol
who works here to support herself!

209
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,118
A sweet girl like her would never kill!

210
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:04,828
An idol?

211
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,790
They look alike,
but I guess she's not Poporon.

212
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,541
Die!

213
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,336
You're Noel?

214
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,631
Jeez, what a drag.

215
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,342
Yes, I'm Noel Amatsuka.

216
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,552
Pleasure to meet you!

217
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,309
Believe it or not, the ramen and fried rice
killer combo originated in Jinbocho.

218
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,187
What would you like today?

219
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,483
Enough with the nonsense.
Hurry up and order.

220
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,026
That was close.

221
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,070
Coming right up!

222
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,740
I see you hired new staff
since the last time I was here.

223
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:45,202
Yup, Noel has spiked the traffic here.

224
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:49,081
-We come here every day.
-Yup!

225
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,250
Thanks for your support!

226
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,421
Today, I'll treat you to stir-fry sprouts
and take it out of my pay.

227
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,760
She's treating us pigs,
using her precious salary!

228
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,887
Thank you so much.
I'm so happy!

229
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,889
Losers.

230
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:10,352
Human men get way too excited over nothing.

231
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,650
That weird pouch.
That has to be Poporon's.

232
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,277
Let's test her.

233
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,363
Poporon, could I have a refill please?

234
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,157
Right away!

235
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:24,908
Damn it!

236
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,953
So you are Poporon!

237
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,666
-Stop it! Viper bitch!
-Don't touch our Noel!

238
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,629
Jashin-chan, this is a place
for all of us to sit down and eat.

239
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:41,091
There's no exception, Jashin-chan.

240
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,301
But she--

241
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,970
Don't point.

242
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,227
Mito Komon is said to be
the first to have ramen in Japan.

243
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:56,482
But another theory suggests it was
a monk during the Muromachi Period.

244
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,777
What you believe is up to you.

245
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:02,196
Check please.

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,531
Okay.

247
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,366
That was very good.

248
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:10,120
-I'm sorry for all the ruckus.
-Yeah...

249
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,539
We're leaving, Jashin-chan.

250
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:24,051
As Jashin-chan said, you aren't just a human.

251
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,513
You exert the same aura
as another girl I know.

252
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,311
That girl subdued the devil.
She knows who I am, too.

253
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:36,313
Who the hell is she?

254
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,440
Dropkick on My Devil!

255
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,152
Stationery.

256
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:47,449
Since it has "station" in it,
it must be a military-related defensive weapon.

257
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,951
Hey, Yurine.

258
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:52,788
I wanna test my defense powers,
so attack me.

259
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:53,997
Sure thing.

260
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:55,707
Now, come at me!

261
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,089
Completely useless.

262
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,508
You're such an idiot.

263
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:15,060
I can't suppress this craving for pudding.

264
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,111
There you are.

265
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,830
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

266
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,419
After my first bite of pudding
in the human world,

267
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,838
I was instantly addicted.

268
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,133
To the point where I suffer withdrawal symptoms.

269
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,720
So good! It's too good!

270
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,639
It permeates through my brain!

271
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:57,603
There are no other sweets
that have this effect on me!

272
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,650
YURINE

273
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,322
Damn it!

274
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,908
This was Yurine's pudding!

275
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,242
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

276
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,621
I need to buy another one
before she gets back!

277
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,706
I'm home.

278
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,960
What's wrong?
Is it the end of the world?

279
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:26,423
It is for me. Everything was clear
before it all fell apart.

280
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,969
Hey, you ate my pudding.

281
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,889
The invisible one.

282
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:37,142
The invisible one.

283
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,520
Watch out!
There's an invisible one lurking around!

284
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,898
There's the culprit!

285
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:46,068
I'm gonna get you!
It just punched me!

286
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,320
Damn you, invisible one!

287
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,281
Take this! Royal Copenha--

288
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,410
I won't let you get away with this!

289
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,579
Damn it, it escaped.

290
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:01,500
I wonder how it escaped
when the window is closed.

291
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,919
Oh, well...

292
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:06,213
That's because...

293
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,131
It went through it?

294
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,801
How do you see it when it's invisible?

295
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:14,429
Because... it's from hell?

296
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:16,640
I see.

297
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,893
-You have pudding on your lips.
-What?

298
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:21,853
Coming.

299
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,022
Delivery!

300
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:29,278
It must be from brawling
with the invisible one just now.

301
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,573
-My order's here.
-Your order?

302
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:36,326
What did you order?

303
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,829
An iron maiden.

304
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:43,333
If you were honest about it,
you could've just bought another one.

305
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,879
But you chose to mock me
with a lame game of charades.

306
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,638
Get me out of here!

307
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:59,808
You better come out before
you run out of blood.

308
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,853
I don't really have a choice, do I?

309
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,563
No!

310
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:32,591
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

311
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:37,387
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

312
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:42,559
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

313
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:47,064
As she starves to death

314
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,649
It's a love and hate relationship

315
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,902
Can't leave each other alone

316
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,531
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

317
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,786
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

318
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:03,163
Test my heart, don't stop

319
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:10,253
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

320
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,633
We're a happy family

321
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:18,762
Let me say, I love you

322
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,223
When all is said and done

323
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:25,811
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

324
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:30,607
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

325
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,859
For another crazy tomorrow

326
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:36,530
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

327
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,413
Nobody is out here because of the fog.

328
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:59,970
-What the hell was that?
-Jashin-chan, help!

329
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:04,099
Medusa, what's going--?

330
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:08,520
Zombies?

331
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,863
Over here! Medusa, hurry up! Run!

332
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,198
Wait!

333
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,203
It's locked!

334
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,540
Damn it, who would lock it?

335
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,709
Jashin-chan, look!

336
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,711
Nice find, Medusa.

337
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,561
-Jashin-chan.
-What is it?

338
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,607
Here's some light.

339
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,109
Hey, it's too bright.

340
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,947
I'll turn it off so they won't catch us.

341
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:10,790
-Let's hide in here.
-Okay.

342
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,841
Come out. Orochimaru.

343
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:28,016
Orochimaru...

344
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,292
You guys okay in there?

345
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,670
Minos, you saved us!

346
00:21:57,003 --> 00:22:00,048
It's not safe here.
They're gathered in the back.

347
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:03,677
-Should we go outside, then?
-That's risky, too.

348
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:06,429
The fog's too thick to see anything.

349
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,473
Then where should we go?

350
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,392
Come with me.

351
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,663
Run for your life!

352
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,209
-We're doomed!
-Over here!

353
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,170
It's a dead end!

354
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,799
This door is locked, too!

355
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:46,803
Please! Someone, open the door!

356
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,222
Please!

357
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:53,768
-It's a sliding door.
-Yurine!

358
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,979
Oh, whoops.

359
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:58,648
-Hurry, Medusa!
-Help!

360
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,237
Hey, don't abandon me! Help!

361
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:08,116
Medusa! Minos! Save me, please!

362
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,118
Someone please!

363
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,789
Jashin-chan.

364
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,209
Are you okay?
You were having a nightmare.

365
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,712
I'm fine.

366
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,840
Please don't scream
in middle of the night.

367
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,717
Okay, I won't.

368
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:26,843
KONNYAKU

369
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:34,100
If you place a damp towel on someone's feet
while they're asleep,

370
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:37,937
they're more prone to nightmares!

371
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:43,610
The evil preys on the good-hearted.

372
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:46,571
An angel of sorrow rises up against them.

373
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,366
What does the angel want to protect?

374
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,827
Dropkick on My Devil!

375
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,997
Next time, a single-winged angel
will steal your heart!

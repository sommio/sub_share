1
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,822
I'm back.

2
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,282
Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,911
Hey, how could you abandon me
like that?

4
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,581
But I'm back now!

5
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,923
Behold, the 7.6 billion people
of the world!

6
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,177
Nineteen years late,
but the feared king returns!

7
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:55,097
You shall look at me
for a glimpse of Angolmois!

8
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,642
This is my latest ultimate
killer technique!

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,729
Super, delicious, cosmic, golden,

10
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,815
special reserve, gorgeous,
ultra, hyper-mega,

11
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,568
marvelous, fantastic,

12
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,696
overload, Giga Drill meteor!

13
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,797
No problem, c'est bon,
está bien, everything's all right!

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,967
Finally! The ultimate
Jashin-chan dropkick!

15
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,873
My Noel!

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,250
Hey, everyone!

17
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,252
Thank you so much!

18
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,089
This can't be!

19
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,715
Sorry, ma'am.

20
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,509
We won't forget again.

21
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,845
Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,181
Congratulations!

23
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,475
We have a jackpot here!

24
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,020
Here's your prize.

25
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,775
A two-day VIP experience
at a private beach!

26
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,458
Damn it.

27
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,918
END

28
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,671
Beth!

29
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,173
It's time to eat!

30
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,219
Huh?

31
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,180
Did you get bigger...?

32
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,851
I feel like she was smaller
before I went to space.

33
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,939
That means we gotta build you
a bigger house.

34
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,694
I keep forgetting
she's the Beast of Gévaudan.

35
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:17,197
Forget the house,
we're gonna need a cage.

36
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,786
How the hell am I supposed
to control such a big beast?

37
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,831
I'll end up as her dinner!

38
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,045
I'll get rid of her while I can!

39
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,589
It's been a drag taking you on walks,

40
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:36,842
feeding you expensive food...
Now's the perfect time.

41
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,677
Goodbye, Beth!

42
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,598
Equally fatal
as my infamous dropkick!

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,601
The Royal Copenhagen!

44
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,358
Don't look so innocent
when I'm about to kill you!

45
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,362
She completely trusts me
as her owner.

46
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,366
But I can't afford to wait
any longer.

47
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,662
How could I do that to you?

48
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:09,249
I've gotten so attached
while taking care of her.

49
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,005
A lordly beast is living,

50
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,925
leashed up,
stripped of freedom.

51
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,928
You're just like me.

52
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,682
I'm sorry, Beth.

53
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,686
What is it?

54
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,438
Quit that! That tickles.

55
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,025
I said stop-- Huh?

56
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,205
She needs to die, now!

57
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,874
I still got my left hand.

58
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,213
Take this!
The Lefty Royal Copenhagen!

59
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,635
No effect at all.

60
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,888
-Hello there.
-Huh?

61
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,599
Yurine!

62
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,560
It's been a while.

63
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,271
Weren't you lonely without me?

64
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,232
You were gone?
I didn't even notice.

65
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,611
What do you mean?
I was gone for three light-years!

66
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,699
You have no idea what I went through
to come back!

67
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,577
I really don't care.
Oh, you dropped this.

68
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,873
Right! Beth is getting bigger
and stronger!

69
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,667
She's becoming a huge threat

70
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,127
to our lives...?

71
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,920
There, there. Good girl.

72
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,089
Don't ignore me.

73
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,385
Now, since you punched Beth
earlier...

74
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:49,016
In the name of Beth,
I will punish you!

75
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,401
I'm the victim here!

76
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,403
I don't deserve the punishment!

77
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,072
I'll punish you!

78
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,450
I give up. She's completely
lost her mind.

79
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,160
No use talking.

80
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,621
Which do you prefer?
A punch or a kick?

81
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,582
What's your preference?

82
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,792
A punch.

83
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,132
Now, it's dinner time for us too.

84
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,428
I'll fix you up with superglue
so make sure to bring it.

85
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,306
Crazy bitch.

86
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,476
Coming up, the swimsuit edition!

87
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,103
Don't miss it!

88
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,667
Yes!

89
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,837
There's nobody here but us!

90
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,925
Can't believe she won
a free private beach trip for six

91
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,095
in the Suzuran
Shopping District raffle!

92
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,889
Yurine has great luck!

93
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,558
Of course I do.

94
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,143
Smile!

95
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,727
Yay!

96
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,772
Lord, please forgive me.

97
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,110
I've surrendered
to the devil's temptation yet again.

98
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,321
I, Pekola, am a sinful angel.

99
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:31,493
But who could say no to barbeque?

100
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,539
Look at this beach.

101
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,043
It's been 3000 years since I went
swimming in the Dead Sea.

102
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,463
The Dead Sea is a lake, not an ocean.

103
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,675
-Keep the beach clean, guys.
-Got it!

104
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,926
Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,387
-Bring back all the trash.
-Got it!

106
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,348
I noticed there's a new devil
in the mix.

107
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,267
-Jashin-chan!
-What?

108
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,228
Your swimsuit is adorable!

109
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,523
It's not adorable, it's strong!

110
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,692
Did you really need to wear that?

111
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,945
Who doesn't wear a swimsuit
to the beach?

112
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,574
We never see eye to eye.

113
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,119
Pekola!

114
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,537
Yes?

115
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,790
Well, that was suspicious.

116
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,709
-Jashin-chan.
-It's nothing.

117
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,502
-What's up?
-What is it?

118
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,756
What are you hiding?
Show us!

119
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,425
No! Please stop.

120
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,678
No need to be shy.
What have you got to lose?

121
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,930
Stop!

122
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,765
Don't be obnoxious.

123
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,436
Tajiri?

124
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,438
Your last name is Tajiri?

125
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,482
Pekola Tajiri, huh?

126
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,942
Hello there.

127
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,070
I'm Persephone II, the devil
who came from hell

128
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,072
to look for Jashin-chan.

129
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,157
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tajiri!

130
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,159
Nice to meet--
No!

131
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,412
I just borrowed this
from a co-worker.

132
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,957
You know I don't have a last name.

133
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,124
Really, Tajiri?

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,585
-Got it, Tajiri.
-Tajiri-chan.

135
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,796
Stop calling me Tajiri!

136
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,341
Hey, Pekola.

137
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:14,846
I just... I just wanted to say
you look cute in a swimsuit too.

138
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,765
Really?

139
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,100
It's true.

140
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,060
You should be punished for it.

141
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,187
It looks too good on you, Pekola.

142
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,071
I'm so cute!

143
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,367
It's so hot!

144
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,245
I can't wear sandals
so the sand feels hot!

145
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,788
Catch me if you can!

146
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,624
Jashin-chan!
You have to warm up first!

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,918
Not listening!

148
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,420
Vega pose!

149
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,340
One, two, three, four!

150
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,301
One, two, three, four!

151
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,386
Warm-ups are crucial.

152
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,179
-Yup!
-Yes.

153
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,275
My foot, I mean,
my tail's cramped up!

154
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,902
Looks so fun, I'm so jealous.

155
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,073
But since I can't swim,
I'll make a sand castle.

156
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:21,371
Scoop, scoop, scoop!

157
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,460
That was a close call.

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,128
Ice! Ice!

159
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,882
How about some refreshing
shaved ice?

160
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,550
Hey, it's Yusa and Koji.

161
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,511
-Welcome.
-Yes, yes!

162
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,806
Yes, yes! How about
an exciting French kiss?

163
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,517
Or do you prefer
an unforgettable deep kiss?

164
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,812
Actually, they're the same thing.

165
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,148
I'd like one shaved ice, please!

166
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:55,572
So cold and refreshing!
Shaved ice is the best!

167
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,077
You want some, Tajiri?

168
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,872
Not until you spin three times
and bark.

169
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,416
Woof.

170
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,836
She really did it!

171
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,089
-Please...?
-Not yet!

172
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,548
Give me a paw.

173
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,759
Jashin-chan.

174
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,054
Are you bullying Pekola?

175
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,806
It's a misunderstanding.

176
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,558
Pekola wanted shaved ice...

177
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,728
Seems like you haven't been
disciplined enough.

178
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,563
Jashin-chan.

179
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,108
You'll get sunburned like that.

180
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,901
Here's a parasol.

181
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,113
But why are you closing it up?

182
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,409
Cut!

183
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,419
-Yay!
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

184
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,171
Here.

185
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,716
I'm sorry Jashin-chan bullied you.

186
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,928
Are you sure? Thanks.

187
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,681
I've been dreaming about you.

188
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,810
Cold and delicious!

189
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,688
The brain freeze feels so good!

190
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,773
How's the ice?

191
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,943
Devils...?

192
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,822
Shoot! This shaved ice
was produced by devils.

193
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,699
Does it taste good?

194
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,705
Yes. It's very good.

195
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,123
I'm glad.

196
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,374
Thank you.

197
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,631
What is it?

198
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,883
Hey, Koji.

199
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,385
It's rude to stare like that.

200
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,305
Look who's talking.

201
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,266
I'll change your name
to Tsugumitsu!

202
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,726
Who's that?

203
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,354
Noto's Suzu District
military commander, Tsugumitsu Yusa!

204
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,732
Yusa, Koji! She's an angel!

205
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,401
Don't let your guard down,
she'll kill you!

206
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,446
What was that?

207
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,619
She says you're more of a threat.

208
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
What?

209
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,623
-You little brat, Koji Tsugumitsu!
-Quit that.

210
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,751
I'll skin you and rub salt
all over your body.

211
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,629
So cold to the touch, feels good!

212
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,139
Making friends with an angel?
Don't make me laugh!

213
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,433
You guys are idiots!

214
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,894
Dumbasses!

215
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,536
They're all so annoying.

216
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,421
Such idiots.

217
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,638
Is it about time?

218
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,146
What's that?

219
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,606
It's a kraken!

220
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,985
-From Norse mythology?
-Yup!

221
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,237
Jashin-chan!

222
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,114
Medusa!

223
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:29,619
Hurry up and save me!
Save me from...

224
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,829
What's his name?

225
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,206
How should I know?

226
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,041
Just save me!

227
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,503
Hey, Mr. Kraken!

228
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,257
Could you please let go
of Jashin-chan?

229
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,260
Idiot!

230
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,595
Hey!

231
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,724
-Jashin-chan!
-Something cracked!

232
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,728
If you're hungry, Medusa's
a lot more flavorful than I am.

233
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,354
Take my spot, Medusa!

234
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,691
I'm worth a lot more than you!

235
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,110
Look over there, big guy!

236
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,988
Eat that girl over there!

237
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,407
-Seriously?
-How despicable.

238
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,284
She really is.

239
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,578
Come on, what are you waiting for?

240
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,247
Wait! Don't eat me!

241
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,667
-He ate her.
-Just like that.

242
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,544
Guys!

243
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,255
She's still your friend, right?

244
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,759
I know she's a sleaze,
but we have to save her!

245
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,178
Change of plans.

246
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,474
-We'll have seafood tonight.
-Where did that come from?

247
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,184
That's fine with me.

248
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,102
Me too!

249
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,646
I'll cheer you on!

250
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,149
Let's take care of him, quick!

251
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,660
Devil blow!

252
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,740
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

253
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,091
Kraken!

254
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,771
That armor's cool!
Hand it over!

255
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,565
You can't do that!

256
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,984
-How about next time?
-Promise?

257
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,362
I gotta be dead, right?

258
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,072
Your body melted.

259
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,824
Are you okay?

260
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,701
Does it look like I am?

261
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,706
This is all because Yurine
summoned me here in the first place.

262
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,670
Or else I would've never come
to the beach!

263
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,255
Look at me!

264
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,050
Yurine's to blame for all of this!

265
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,846
I despise you...

266
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,598
I hate you!

267
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,726
-What's happening?
-Jashin-chan?

268
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,945
Give me the answer I desire!

269
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,531
Ancient woman warrior!

270
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,577
Amazon!

271
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,462
-Here?
-Just hurry up and strip!

272
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,130
This thing too!

273
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,549
-Take it all off!
-Oh, no!

274
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,309
Look at me in this awesome armor!

275
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,269
You savage.

276
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,981
Victory's mine! I'll finish her!

277
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,274
Goodbye, Yurine!

278
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,154
You never learn, huh?

279
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,241
Fine, I'll fight you.

280
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,281
Beth!

281
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,208
Beth?

282
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,716
You're gonna end up dead,
just like Yurine!

283
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,472
Beth!

284
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,295
I won't let you get away
with this!

285
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,674
Full Armor
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

286
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,642
The battle

287
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,645
still

288
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,980
continues...

289
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,326
Looks delicious!

290
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,245
What do you wanna eat first?

291
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,998
This smells so good!

292
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,626
It melts in my mouth.

293
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,127
I wanna eat it all.

294
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,470
There we go.

295
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,575
Delicious!

296
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,832
Who knew kraken tasted so good?

297
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,792
Let me try!

298
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,044
Delicious!

299
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,422
Me too, me too!

300
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,427
They know they're eating kraken, right?

301
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,388
Have a bite, Pekola.

302
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,683
There's no way-- I mean,

303
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,019
-I'm quite full--
-Here.

304
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,278
Delicious!

305
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,321
Eat up, Pekola.

306
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,365
Here's another piece.

307
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,784
Yes, please.

308
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,676
I know you're not a lefty.

309
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,187
I can feed myself,
I'm not a baby!

310
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,398
I don't need your help at all,
Yurine.

311
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,192
Mind your own business!

312
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,987
Let's have a peaceful dinner.

313
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,532
Fine. I'll be helped.

314
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,951
Here, say, "Ah."

315
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,412
Really?

316
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,456
Shut up and eat.

317
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,344
It's so good-- Huh?

318
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,060
Didn't realize you were that close
with the witch.

319
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,228
Tajiri!

320
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,814
-They're not close.
-Not at all.

321
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,148
They're intimate!

322
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,443
-Not at all!
-Don't be shy.

323
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,820
Just admit it.

324
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,114
What the hell are you talking about?

325
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,991
Admit it, just admit it.

326
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,494
Just admit it!

327
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,418
Damn it!
You're all gonna regret this later!

1
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,301
I'm back.

2
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,761
Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:36,391
Hey, how could you abandon me
like that?

4
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:39,060
But I'm back now!

5
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:48,403
Behold, the 7.6 billion people
of the world!

6
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:51,698
Nineteen years late,
but the feared king returns!

7
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,618
You shall look at me
for a glimpse of Angolmois!

8
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:59,122
This is my latest ultimate
killer technique!

9
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,250
Super, delicious, cosmic, golden,

10
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:05,336
special reserve, gorgeous,
ultra, hyper-mega,

11
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,089
marvelous, fantastic,

12
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:11,217
overload, Giga Drill meteor!

13
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:28,318
No problem, c'est bon,
está bien, everything's all right!

14
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:32,488
Finally! The ultimate
Jashin-chan dropkick!

15
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,353
My Noel!

16
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,771
Hey, everyone!

17
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,731
Thank you so much!

18
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,610
This can't be!

19
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,236
Sorry, ma'am.

20
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,030
We won't forget again.

21
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,366
Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,660
Congratulations!

23
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,996
We have a jackpot here!

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,500
Here's your prize.

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,296
A two-day VIP experience
at a private beach!

26
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:46,979
Damn it.

27
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,439
END

28
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,150
Beth!

29
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:53,653
It's time to eat!

30
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,740
Huh?

31
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:00,660
Did you get bigger...?

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,330
I feel like she was smaller
before I went to space.

33
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,460
That means we gotta build you
a bigger house.

34
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,173
I keep forgetting
she's the Beast of Gévaudan.

35
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:17,718
Forget the house,
we're gonna need a cage.

36
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:23,307
How the hell am I supposed
to control such a big beast?

37
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,310
I'll end up as her dinner!

38
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,566
I'll get rid of her while I can!

39
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,110
It's been a drag taking you on walks,

40
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:37,321
feeding you expensive food...
Now's the perfect time.

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,198
Goodbye, Beth!

42
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:43,119
Equally fatal
as my infamous dropkick!

43
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:46,080
The Royal Copenhagen!

44
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,879
Don't look so innocent
when I'm about to kill you!

45
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:56,841
She completely trusts me
as her owner.

46
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:00,887
But I can't afford to wait
any longer.

47
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,141
How could I do that to you?

48
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:09,770
I've gotten so attached
while taking care of her.

49
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,526
A lordly beast is living,

50
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,446
leashed up,
stripped of freedom.

51
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,449
You're just like me.

52
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,161
I'm sorry, Beth.

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,207
What is it?

54
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:31,959
Quit that! That tickles.

55
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:35,546
I said stop-- Huh?

56
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,726
She needs to die, now!

57
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,354
I still got my left hand.

58
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,692
Take this!
The Lefty Royal Copenhagen!

59
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,156
No effect at all.

60
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,409
-Hello there.
-Huh?

61
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:08,120
Yurine!

62
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,081
It's been a while.

63
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:12,750
Weren't you lonely without me?

64
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,711
You were gone?
I didn't even notice.

65
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:20,091
What do you mean?
I was gone for three light-years!

66
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:24,220
You have no idea what I went through
to come back!

67
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:27,098
I really don't care.
Oh, you dropped this.

68
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:31,352
Right! Beth is getting bigger
and stronger!

69
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,188
She's becoming a huge threat

70
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,648
to our lives...?

71
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,400
There, there. Good girl.

72
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,610
Don't ignore me.

73
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:43,906
Now, since you punched Beth
earlier...

74
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:49,537
In the name of Beth,
I will punish you!

75
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,880
I'm the victim here!

76
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,882
I don't deserve the punishment!

77
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,551
I'll punish you!

78
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:06,971
I give up. She's completely
lost her mind.

79
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,681
No use talking.

80
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,100
Which do you prefer?
A punch or a kick?

81
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,061
What's your preference?

82
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,271
A punch.

83
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:22,612
Now, it's dinner time for us too.

84
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:26,949
I'll fix you up with superglue
so make sure to bring it.

85
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,827
Crazy bitch.

86
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,997
Coming up, the swimsuit edition!

87
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:34,582
Don't miss it!

88
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:57,188
Yes!

89
00:06:57,313 --> 00:07:00,358
There's nobody here but us!

90
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,446
Can't believe she won
a free private beach trip for six

91
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,616
in the Suzuran
Shopping District raffle!

92
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,410
Yurine has great luck!

93
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:13,079
Of course I do.

94
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:14,622
Smile!

95
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,248
Yay!

96
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,251
Lord, please forgive me.

97
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,631
I've surrendered
to the devil's temptation yet again.

98
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:26,801
I, Pekola, am a sinful angel.

99
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:31,972
But who could say no to barbeque?

100
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,060
Look at this beach.

101
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,523
It's been 3000 years since I went
swimming in the Dead Sea.

102
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,943
The Dead Sea is a lake, not an ocean.

103
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,196
-Keep the beach clean, guys.
-Got it!

104
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,447
Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:50,908
-Bring back all the trash.
-Got it!

106
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,869
I noticed there's a new devil
in the mix.

107
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,788
-Jashin-chan!
-What?

108
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:58,749
Your swimsuit is adorable!

109
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:02,002
It's not adorable, it's strong!

110
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,171
Did you really need to wear that?

111
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,466
Who doesn't wear a swimsuit
to the beach?

112
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:11,053
We never see eye to eye.

113
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,640
Pekola!

114
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,058
Yes?

115
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:19,270
Well, that was suspicious.

116
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,230
-Jashin-chan.
-It's nothing.

117
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:22,982
-What's up?
-What is it?

118
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,277
What are you hiding?
Show us!

119
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:28,946
No! Please stop.

120
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:32,199
No need to be shy.
What have you got to lose?

121
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:33,451
Stop!

122
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,286
Don't be obnoxious.

123
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:39,957
Tajiri?

124
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,959
Your last name is Tajiri?

125
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,961
Pekola Tajiri, huh?

126
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,421
Hello there.

127
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:48,591
I'm Persephone II, the devil
who came from hell

128
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:50,551
to look for Jashin-chan.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,678
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tajiri!

130
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,680
Nice to meet--
No!

131
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,892
I just borrowed this
from a co-worker.

132
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,478
You know I don't have a last name.

133
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:01,604
Really, Tajiri?

134
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,106
-Got it, Tajiri.
-Tajiri-chan.

135
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,317
Stop calling me Tajiri!

136
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,820
Hey, Pekola.

137
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:15,367
I just... I just wanted to say
you look cute in a swimsuit too.

138
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,286
Really?

139
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,621
It's true.

140
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:20,581
You should be punished for it.

141
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:22,708
It looks too good on you, Pekola.

142
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,550
I'm so cute!

143
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:35,888
It's so hot!

144
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,766
I can't wear sandals
so the sand feels hot!

145
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,309
Catch me if you can!

146
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:43,103
Jashin-chan!
You have to warm up first!

147
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,439
Not listening!

148
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:46,941
Vega pose!

149
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,820
One, two, three, four!

150
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,780
One, two, three, four!

151
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,907
Warm-ups are crucial.

152
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:56,700
-Yup!
-Yes.

153
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,796
My foot, I mean,
my tail's cramped up!

154
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,382
Looks so fun, I'm so jealous.

155
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,553
But since I can't swim,
I'll make a sand castle.

156
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:21,851
Scoop, scoop, scoop!

157
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,981
That was a close call.

158
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:28,649
Ice! Ice!

159
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:32,361
How about some refreshing
shaved ice?

160
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,029
Hey, it's Yusa and Koji.

161
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:36,991
-Welcome.
-Yes, yes!

162
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,327
Yes, yes! How about
an exciting French kiss?

163
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,038
Or do you prefer
an unforgettable deep kiss?

164
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,292
Actually, they're the same thing.

165
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,669
I'd like one shaved ice, please!

166
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:56,051
So cold and refreshing!
Shaved ice is the best!

167
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,598
You want some, Tajiri?

168
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,351
Not until you spin three times
and bark.

169
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,937
Woof.

170
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,357
She really did it!

171
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,610
-Please...?
-Not yet!

172
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,069
Give me a paw.

173
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,280
Jashin-chan.

174
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,533
Are you bullying Pekola?

175
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,327
It's a misunderstanding.

176
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:24,079
Pekola wanted shaved ice...

177
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:27,249
Seems like you haven't been
disciplined enough.

178
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,043
Jashin-chan.

179
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,629
You'll get sunburned like that.

180
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,380
Here's a parasol.

181
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:36,592
But why are you closing it up?

182
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,930
Cut!

183
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:50,940
-Yay!
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

184
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,651
Here.

185
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,237
I'm sorry Jashin-chan bullied you.

186
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:00,449
Are you sure? Thanks.

187
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,160
I've been dreaming about you.

188
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,331
Cold and delicious!

189
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,209
The brain freeze feels so good!

190
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,252
How's the ice?

191
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,422
Devils...?

192
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:19,301
Shoot! This shaved ice
was produced by devils.

193
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,220
Does it taste good?

194
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:27,226
Yes. It's very good.

195
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,602
I'm glad.

196
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,853
Thank you.

197
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,111
What is it?

198
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,362
Hey, Koji.

199
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,906
It's rude to stare like that.

200
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,826
Look who's talking.

201
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:46,787
I'll change your name
to Tsugumitsu!

202
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,247
Who's that?

203
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,834
Noto's Suzu District
military commander, Tsugumitsu Yusa!

204
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,211
Yusa, Koji! She's an angel!

205
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,880
Don't let your guard down,
she'll kill you!

206
00:12:58,716 --> 00:12:59,967
What was that?

207
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:06,140
She says you're more of a threat.

208
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:07,307
What?

209
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:10,102
-You little brat, Koji Tsugumitsu!
-Quit that.

210
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:13,230
I'll skin you and rub salt
all over your body.

211
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,150
So cold to the touch, feels good!

212
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:26,660
Making friends with an angel?
Don't make me laugh!

213
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,912
You guys are idiots!

214
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,373
Dumbasses!

215
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,057
They're all so annoying.

216
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,901
Such idiots.

217
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:07,159
Is it about time?

218
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,667
What's that?

219
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,127
It's a kraken!

220
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:20,506
-From Norse mythology?
-Yup!

221
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,758
Jashin-chan!

222
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,593
Medusa!

223
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,140
Hurry up and save me!
Save me from...

224
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,350
What's his name?

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,727
How should I know?

226
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,521
Just save me!

227
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:38,982
Hey, Mr. Kraken!

228
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,778
Could you please let go
of Jashin-chan?

229
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:45,781
Idiot!

230
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,116
Hey!

231
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,203
-Jashin-chan!
-Something cracked!

232
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:55,249
If you're hungry, Medusa's
a lot more flavorful than I am.

233
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:56,834
Take my spot, Medusa!

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm worth a lot more than you!

235
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,589
Look over there, big guy!

236
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:05,509
Eat that girl over there!

237
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,928
-Seriously?
-How despicable.

238
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,763
She really is.

239
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,099
Come on, what are you waiting for?

240
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,768
Wait! Don't eat me!

241
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:18,188
-He ate her.
-Just like that.

242
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,023
Guys!

243
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,776
She's still your friend, right?

244
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:26,280
I know she's a sleaze,
but we have to save her!

245
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:28,699
Change of plans.

246
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:32,953
-We'll have seafood tonight.
-Where did that come from?

247
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:34,663
That's fine with me.

248
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,582
Me too!

249
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,167
I'll cheer you on!

250
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,670
Let's take care of him, quick!

251
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,181
Devil blow!

252
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:31,220
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

253
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,570
Kraken!

254
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:02,251
That armor's cool!
Hand it over!

255
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,086
You can't do that!

256
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:06,463
-How about next time?
-Promise?

257
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:09,841
I gotta be dead, right?

258
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,551
Your body melted.

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,303
Are you okay?

260
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,180
Does it look like I am?

261
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:20,227
This is all because Yurine
summoned me here in the first place.

262
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:26,149
Or else I would've never come
to the beach!

263
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,776
Look at me!

264
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:31,530
Yurine's to blame for all of this!

265
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,367
I despise you...

266
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,119
I hate you!

267
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:40,247
-What's happening?
-Jashin-chan?

268
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,466
Give me the answer I desire!

269
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,011
Ancient woman warrior!

270
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:58,098
Amazon!

271
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,941
-Here?
-Just hurry up and strip!

272
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,609
This thing too!

273
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:12,070
-Take it all off!
-Oh, no!

274
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,830
Look at me in this awesome armor!

275
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:23,790
You savage.

276
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,461
Victory's mine! I'll finish her!

277
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:28,754
Goodbye, Yurine!

278
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,633
You never learn, huh?

279
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,720
Fine, I'll fight you.

280
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:16,760
Beth!

281
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:27,729
Beth?

282
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:35,237
You're gonna end up dead,
just like Yurine!

283
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:41,952
Beth!

284
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,816
I won't let you get away
with this!

285
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:17,154
Full Armor
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

286
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:26,121
The battle

287
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,166
still

288
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,460
continues...

289
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,847
Looks delicious!

290
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:46,766
What do you wanna eat first?

291
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,519
This smells so good!

292
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:52,147
It melts in my mouth.

293
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:53,648
I wanna eat it all.

294
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,949
There we go.

295
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,096
Delicious!

296
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:31,311
Who knew kraken tasted so good?

297
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,271
Let me try!

298
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,524
Delicious!

299
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,901
Me too, me too!

300
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,948
They know they're eating kraken, right?

301
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:45,909
Have a bite, Pekola.

302
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:49,162
There's no way-- I mean,

303
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,540
-I'm quite full--
-Here.

304
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:00,799
Delicious!

305
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,801
Eat up, Pekola.

306
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:04,886
Here's another piece.

307
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,264
Yes, please.

308
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,197
I know you're not a lefty.

309
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,708
I can feed myself,
I'm not a baby!

310
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,919
I don't need your help at all,
Yurine.

311
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,671
Mind your own business!

312
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,508
Let's have a peaceful dinner.

313
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:47,012
Fine. I'll be helped.

314
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,431
Here, say, "Ah."

315
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,891
Really?

316
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,977
Shut up and eat.

317
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,823
It's so good-- Huh?

318
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,581
Didn't realize you were that close
with the witch.

319
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:15,749
Tajiri!

320
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:18,293
-They're not close.
-Not at all.

321
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,669
They're intimate!

322
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:22,922
-Not at all!
-Don't be shy.

323
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,341
Just admit it.

324
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:26,593
What the hell are you talking about?

325
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:29,471
Admit it, just admit it.

326
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,973
Just admit it!

327
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,939
Damn it!
You're all gonna regret this later!

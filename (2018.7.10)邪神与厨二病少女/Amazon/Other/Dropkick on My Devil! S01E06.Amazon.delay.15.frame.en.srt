1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:05,235
Won’t leave

2
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:11,032
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,205
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,136
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:34,722
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,557
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,311
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,188
If you go too far,

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:46,234
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,486
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:52,615
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:56,786
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:01,082
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,838
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:09,757
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,177
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:18,266
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:21,477
But until then,

20
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:27,442
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

21
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,614
Dinner's ready!

22
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:38,036
I'm serving curry tonight.

23
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:43,666
Nice, pork cutlet curry.

24
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,711
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

25
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:50,048
-All done.
-All done.

26
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,266
Curry for dinner, huh?
Looks good!

27
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,104
THE NIGHT AFTER

28
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:08,316
Curry for dinner again!

29
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,985
It's hamburger steak curry tonight.

30
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:14,364
Curry's best on the second day.

31
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,116
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

32
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,786
-All done.
-All done!

33
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,623
THE NIGHT AFTER.
AGAIN.

34
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:26,834
That's right! It's curry three nights in a row!

35
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,836
That's a bit excessive...

36
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:32,757
We shouldn't be doing this,
even for just 20 minutes.

37
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,675
Not to worry.

38
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,552
This is the last time.

39
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,223
Still, it's three days in a row...

40
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:42,809
Rock, paper...

41
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,477
-Scissors.
-Scissors.

42
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,229
I didn't mean to win.

43
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,108
Jashin-chan, you just won

44
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:53,236
the privilege of getting out the mayo.

45
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,987
Yes! Right away!

46
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:58,783
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

47
00:02:58,908 --> 00:02:59,617
YURINE

48
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:08,042
Is-- Is that for your curry?

49
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,627
Of course.

50
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:12,672
Mayo on curry?

51
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:14,674
That's sacrilege!

52
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,926
They really go well together.

53
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,389
Here, try it.

54
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,526
-It's delicious!
-See?

55
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,446
But why? How is that possible?

56
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,156
Can't go wrong with mayo.

57
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:42,243
That didn't answer my question.
Nevertheless, it's good.

58
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,744
No doubt about it.

59
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,665
Curry and mayo,
the winning combo.

60
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:49,375
No doubt!

61
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:50,751
That's it!

62
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,922
-I'm making curry again tomorrow!
-Again?

63
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,931
Look at that.

64
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:07,101
So, you can buy
these things on Amazon.

65
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,521
You're really making curry again?

66
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:13,774
Yup. It's chicken curry tonight.

67
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,445
If you power walk

68
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:22,617
I live five minutes away
From the station.

69
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,036
The katar or chakram...

70
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,413
Which do you think is sharper?

71
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,627
Hey.

72
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:34,795
Are you listening to me?

73
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,339
What?

74
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,133
She disappeared.

75
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,763
What's going on?

76
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,848
What just happened?

77
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,433
Let me explain!

78
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,436
While Jashin-chan
was stirring the curry,

79
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:54,565
she unintentionally formed
a magic circle

80
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,901
and sacrificed the chicken!

81
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:02,657
Furthermore, her random song matched up with the spell
that opened the gates to the other dimension.

82
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,201
Five minutes away
From the station

83
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,247
Jashin-chan was sucked into a warp!

84
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,376
Where am I?

85
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:16,003
Looks familiar, but...

86
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,217
The entrance to Hell!

87
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,927
Welcome to Hell
Free parking available in 666 miles

88
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:27,306
How did stirring the curry
get me here?

89
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,475
Maybe...!

90
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:31,727
The kitchen exploded...

91
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,312
BANG

92
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:36,065
And killed Yurine?

93
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,734
Oh, no!

94
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,574
No, if that's the case,
I'd be dead too.

95
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:47,743
I don't get what happened.

96
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,996
But if all the conditions aren't met,

97
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:52,999
I'm just gonna get turned away.

98
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:57,712
Hey, she looks like Jashin-chan,
all grown up.

99
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:02,883
Only the fact that she's half-viper.
Otherwise, not at all.

100
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:06,262
She's identical to you!
She must be a relative.

101
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:16,397
Tiny Medusa, Minos...

102
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,274
And me!

103
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,902
Seems like she knows us.

104
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:23,738
See? She's a relative.

105
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,115
Are you my relative?

106
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,117
Where are you from?

107
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:33,581
I was cooking in the human world just a minute ago.
Before I knew it, I was here.

108
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:34,999
The human world?

109
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,879
Isn't the human world completely vacant
because of the great flood?

110
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:45,384
The great flood...?
The one from 7000 years ago?

111
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:47,678
Noah!

112
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:52,391
Does that mean
I went back in time?

113
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:59,357
So, you're saying that you're Jashin-chan
from the future?

114
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:01,942
I'm sure you don't believe it.

115
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:03,944
I believe you.

116
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:07,615
Your eyes don't lie.

117
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:10,201
Medusa, as adorable as you are,

118
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:12,995
don't let some fool deceive you.

119
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:15,915
-Hey, miss!
-Yeah?

120
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,125
What am I like in the future?

121
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,798
That flat chest of yours

122
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,592
is about triple the size!

123
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,971
Triple the size?
That sounds powerful!

124
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,306
You are strong.

125
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:34,225
But, not as strong as me.

126
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:35,935
What about me?

127
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,815
-You're always working.
-Really?

128
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,819
One of the most wonderful inventions
of the future is the ATM...

129
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,697
Me! What about me?

130
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:50,116
-This.
-What?

131
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:52,451
You're looking straight at it.

132
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,621
No way!

133
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:59,625
I was planning on becoming
a lot cooler!

134
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,837
In your dreams!

135
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:09,218
This is bad. I have no idea
how to get back to the human world.

136
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,763
Leave that to us!

137
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:16,434
We'll send you back
with our secret ritual.

138
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,188
Curry's up!

139
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:26,694
DROPKICK ON MY DEVIL!

140
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,865
Now that's some fiery curry.

141
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,295
I remember this.

142
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:47,006
But it's not gonna work.

143
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,842
We tried so many times.

144
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,054
We always failed.

145
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,641
Look, she disappeared.

146
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,019
Did it work?

147
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:04,064
Did you wish really hard
for her return?

148
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:07,485
-Nope! I was dreaming about dinner!
-What?

149
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:10,029
I'm starving!
I wonder what's for dinner tonight.

150
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,697
I hope it's curry.

151
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,032
Curry? That sounds good.

152
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,284
-I love chicken curry.
-Is she okay?

153
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,536
Beef curry's my favorite,
hands down.

154
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:20,831
-Hey, that makes you a cannibal.
-Shut up.

155
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,459
DEVILISHLY DELICIOUS NAAN

156
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,085
Ouch.

157
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:27,046
What?

158
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:29,006
Finally, I'm back.

159
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,467
Where in the world have you been?

160
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,179
One minute, you're gone.

161
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,015
Next thing you know,
you're on the table

162
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,726
destroying all the food.

163
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:45,981
Did you know that curry stains
are impossible to get out?

164
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,237
Amazon delivery!

165
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:57,076
I just ordered a minute ago.

166
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,412
And it's already here.

167
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:03,374
Thank goodness for Prime.

168
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,255
They're both really sharp.

169
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,132
I'm shocked you kept
on eating dinner

170
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:16,262
when I suddenly vanished
in front of your eyes!

171
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,222
Curry again?

172
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,224
Looks good!

173
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,519
Patience is key
when it comes to love and curry!

174
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,237
August is almost over.

175
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,239
But it's still really hot.

176
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:41,036
Don't ignore me. Say something.

177
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,835
That shaved ice from the stand
was awesome!

178
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,213
Yeah! The lemon flavor was crazy good.

179
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,716
I wanna eat shaved ice!

180
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,511
Was there a shaved ice stand
around here?

181
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,513
Could that be it?

182
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:01,974
SHAVED ICE

183
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,269
Come and enjoy some shaved ice!

184
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,022
Hey, it's Yusa and Koji!

185
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:11,108
Hey, you two. How are you?

186
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,694
It was you guys.

187
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,363
It's the off-season in Hell right now.

188
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,449
So we came out here to work.

189
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,493
-It's pretty good money.
-What?

190
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,662
You get rich off shaved ice?

191
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,456
Jashin-chan...

192
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:29,585
They're only able to make profit
because there's no overhead

193
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,004
in producing the ice and syrups.

194
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,881
It won't be the same for you.

195
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,177
Too late.

196
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:44,808
Brain freeze! That's cold!

197
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,646
I'm gonna make a killing
off shaved ice too!

198
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,025
If Yusa's selling theirs
for 200 yen...

199
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,612
I'll sell it for 300!

200
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:00,532
Dummy. They'll all go for the cheaper one.

201
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,868
I'd like a melon one please!

202
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,496
-Sold!
-No way.

203
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,625
Here they come!

204
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,337
This heat must be getting to everyone.

205
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:20,135
This shaved ice machine
is really inefficient.

206
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:25,891
They're able to produce ice
in a split second.

207
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:31,897
Damn it! Those brats!

208
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:37,486
I'll operate three machines,
with hands and my tail!

209
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:39,405
Hilarious

210
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:45,035
Head pain caused by eating
shaved ice is also called

211
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,996
an "ice cream" headache.

212
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:49,748
That's an official medical term.

213
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:54,712
I scream after that first bite
of shaved ice!

214
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:58,215
JASHIN SHAVED ICE

215
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,594
It's completely dead now.

216
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,265
They still have a huge line.

217
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:12,438
Damn you, Koji!
I'll change your name to Mimori

218
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:15,357
so it's harder for you
to establish character.

219
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:18,569
That's a pretty obscure reference.

220
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:22,156
Wow, it's so light!

221
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,491
This is heavenly!

222
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:27,244
How ironic, they're devils.

223
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,708
The cheap ice, flavored syrups,

224
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,085
and toy-like shaved ice machine

225
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:39,006
can't compete with their
light and powdery ice.

226
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:42,634
I must obtain the best ingredient to win!

227
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,766
I'm going on a quest for natural ice
from Mount Fuji!

228
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,988
The air is so thin.

229
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,908
But I made it to the sacred place.

230
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,245
I hope...

231
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,915
I find Jashin-chan soon.

232
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:17,544
Ice, ice, ice!

233
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,923
I'm fully stocked.

234
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:23,634
Where did all that energy come from?

235
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,054
To achieve the finest ice...

236
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:31,725
I got a professional shaved ice
machine and expensive syrups!

237
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,479
-Voila!
-Where did you get the money?

238
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,359
Medusa, I bought all of this
with your money

239
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,277
so I could win.

240
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,905
-Good luck.
-She died?

241
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:48,283
In order to bring Yusa
and Koji down,

242
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:49,952
I'm selling mine

243
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,995
for only five yen!

244
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:54,248
You can kiss profit goodbye.

245
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,546
I'll produce better-quality ice to beat them!

246
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:04,091
-That wasn't her initial objective.
-Fluffy, fluffy ice!

247
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,221
Yusa and Koji, you guys

248
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,056
are about to be annihilated!

249
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,642
Now, humans...

250
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:17,855
Come and buy
the ultimate shaved ice!

251
00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:20,732
Not so fast, viper girl.

252
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,612
You don't have a permit
to do business here.

253
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,364
A permit?

254
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,535
We have our permit, of course.

255
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:32,744
PERMIT

256
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,998
You can't do business here.

257
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,085
You'd better come with us.

258
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:43,213
I see you're half-viper...

259
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:46,758
-but your upper half could make you rich.
-What?

260
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:49,595
Well, actually,
I've got a viper fetish.

261
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:54,183
I think she wants you to save her.

262
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:58,312
No, that's the "Don't worry, I've got this" look.

263
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:01,273
Come on over! It's hot and fresh!

264
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,482
One please!

265
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,609
CURRY SHAVED ICE

266
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:11,742
All right. That should do it.

267
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,497
Wow, this is heavy.

268
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:22,127
I've got no stamina
since I haven't been eating.

269
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,675
Where did this random huge rock come from?

270
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:33,472
If only I had my halo, I could turn that into bread.

271
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,438
That's enough water
for today and tomorrow.

272
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,734
How did that get ripped?

273
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,074
Pekola, I found you.

274
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:56,036
You're the angel apprentice.

275
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:57,496
That's me, Poporon.

276
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,791
But I'm a full-fledged angel now,
thank you very much.

277
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:08,423
The angel radar app didn't sense you.
So that was quite a feat.

278
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:11,635
As you can see, I lost my halo.

279
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:14,554
So there was no way
for me to contact Heaven.

280
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,723
That's why the radar didn't work.

281
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,561
I've been dreaming of this day.

282
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,524
I can finally go back to Heaven now!

283
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,695
When I go back, I'm gonna relax in a hot bath.

284
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:35,367
Nourish myself with nectar and a feast.

285
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:39,371
Then I'll fall into a deep sleep in a warm bed.

286
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:42,666
What are you waiting for?
Take me back to Heaven!

287
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,712
Good-bye, Pekola.

288
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,805
Stop, don't move.

289
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,308
What's going on?

290
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:01,768
Here's another one!

291
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,354
Ready? Yakisoba!

292
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,824
But why?

293
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:22,831
I'm currently serving as your substitute,
since you're missing.

294
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:29,212
But if you return,
I go back to being an apprentice again.

295
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:34,301
That'll put an end to my glory days
of bossing other angels around.

296
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,346
I don't follow at all.

297
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,307
You're as thick as a brick!

298
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:46,313
As long as you stay out of Heaven,
I'll be treated like royalty!

299
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:51,276
So you're not here to bring me back...

300
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:55,197
I'm here to get rid of you for good.

301
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,825
Just when I thought...

302
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:01,703
I was about to go home.

303
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:03,955
How could this be...?

304
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:10,253
I'm so lucky to find you
stripped of angel powers.

305
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,047
Now you're just a piece of meat.

306
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,965
-Meat...
-No, more like waste.

307
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,176
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

308
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,306
I always had a feeling
she wasn't an angel at heart.

309
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,433
But this is just ridiculous.

310
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:27,646
I'm not an angel because I'm worthy of it...

311
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:31,775
I'm an angel because
I was born to become one.

312
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:36,822
Hey, what's up?

313
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,783
Is this a bad time?

314
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,535
A devil?

315
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:45,497
Yurine sent me to deliver this curry to you .

316
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:46,998
Curry!

317
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,336
But I can't accept charity from a witch.

318
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:55,048
-What? You can't eat my curry?
-Hey!

319
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,968
-It's out of this world good.
-Hey!

320
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,845
You're in the way!

321
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:03,181
I'll finish you later.
Get out of the way!

322
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,523
You call that curry?
It's all potatoes.

323
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,275
Now get out of my sight.

324
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:14,985
Tastes good!

325
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,404
Curry's best the second day.

326
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:20,365
Day three of simmering in the pot.

327
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:27,497
Garam masala!

328
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:32,586
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

329
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:34,546
Die!

330
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:39,468
How could you do that to my curry?

331
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:42,179
Waste human lives all you want!

332
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:46,016
But don't you ever waste precious food!

333
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,852
-Give me the packing tape!
-Okay.

334
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,771
Take that!

335
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:01,865
Kazuyo, this is revenge
for breaking up with me.

336
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:02,908
WILL

337
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:06,495
Dear God, please forgive me
for wasting this life.

338
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:21,718
I don't wanna die!
Save me, Mommy!

339
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,434
No sight of Poporon...

340
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:32,145
Who was that anyway?

341
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:35,106
-Oh, well--
-Never mind, I don't care.

342
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:37,526
I'm famished from running so hard.

343
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:39,361
Let's go.

344
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:44,115
Yurine won't believe my story,
that a weirdo spilled my curry.

345
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:48,662
Rather than having her send me back out,
let's just eat together.

346
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,414
But it's a devil's...

347
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,834
Stop making such a fuss. Let's go.

348
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:58,421
You can't let my curry go to waste.

349
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,845
I hate to admit it,
but I was saved by this devil today.

350
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,457
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

351
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,421
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

352
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:44,718
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

353
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:49,139
As she starves to death!

354
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,766
It’s a love and hate relationship,

355
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,977
can’t leave each other alone

356
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:58,648
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

357
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:02,902

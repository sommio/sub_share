00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,169
JULY 9TH

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,632
LIFE THEATER

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,177
I blew it again.

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,933
That was my 17,711th attempt!

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,646
Won't leave

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:26,444
Without a dropkick on her

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,533
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

8
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:47,590
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

9
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,092
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

10
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,011
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,600
If you go too far

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,604
I'll slice you up completely

14
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,898
Your halo
Must get it back

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,027
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

16
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,323
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

17
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,452
I'll never give up

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,120
Yurine, you're off your guard!

19
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,291
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

20
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,211
Huh? What? I missed...

21
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,631
Can't leave Earth

22
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,677
Without a dropkick on her

23
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,931
But until then

24
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:42,853
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

25
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,068
Medusa!

26
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,990
What is it, Jashin-chan?
You look so serious.

27
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,700
-We're going to the bank.
-What?

28
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,912
No, resist that urge! Don't rob the bank!

29
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,372
Please don't!

30
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,458
Chill out. We're just withdrawing your money.

31
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,460
Oh, you got me there.

32
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,128
Well, the slots got me.

33
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,840
-I'm so relieved.
-Don't be.

34
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,259
My actions rewrite history.

35
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,678
This is the last time.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,848
Now, let's get going to the bank.

37
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:32,361
How the hell did we end up
in the middle of a bank robbery?

38
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,113
Don't make a sound!

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,073
Don't get smart with us.

40
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,326
I should have sent you here alone.

41
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,704
I never signed up for this!

42
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,125
You! Viper girl, cut the whining or I'll kill you.

43
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:50,588
I don't care what happens to her,
just spare my life, won't you?

44
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,006
How could you!

45
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,092
Another word and you're both dead.

46
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,928
Mom, I wanna play cards.

47
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,598
-Quiet, not now.
-This sucks.

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,312
Jashin-chan, do you think your dropkick
could take these humans out?

49
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,356
You're a devil, you should punish them.

50
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,610
But if I miss, they'd kill me.
Why risk my life?

51
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:17,239
Even devils aren't immune
to a bullet in the head.

52
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,909
But you have to protect everyone!

53
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,578
Mom, I'm starving.

54
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,121
Hang in there.

55
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,916
I'm supposed to take my meds right now.

56
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,627
I can't let my pet chick starve to death.

57
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,796
I can't afford to miss today's business meeting.

58
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,842
I'm missing out on Miyutan's handshake event.

59
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,677
Guess I'm late for work.

60
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,681
-Baby coming...
-I'm going to pee my pants!

61
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,434
Fine, all right.

62
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,936
Jashin-chan!

63
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,648
If you're so inclined, go for it.

64
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,192
I'll be an innocent bystander who lives.

65
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,947
I should look for another gig.

66
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,533
-Baby...
-I need those meds to stay thin.

67
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,661
-This is horrible!
-My poor chick!

68
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,663
You're really going for it?

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,331
Yes.

70
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:11,001
-Are we done?
-No, not yet.

71
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,796
Hey, move again and you're dead.

72
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,465
What's with the paper bag?

73
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,928
Excuse me, would you please
take a look at my eyes?

74
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,932
Hey, she's pretty cute!

75
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,688
Well done.

76
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,858
Everyone, we're safe now.

77
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,821
-What just happened?
-No idea, but we're safe now!

78
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,698
She looks like Miyutan!

79
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,574
-Thank you.
-Paper bag girl!

80
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,742
Thanks.

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,786
The baby's born, I'm ecstatic.

82
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,580
I couldn't hold it.
It's all lukewarm for me.

83
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,252
My dropkick would've been just as effective,
you know.

84
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,380
But I'll let Medusa take all the credit here.

85
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,390
Orochimaru! That was quite a feat!

86
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:10,269
Oh, that was nothing, really.

87
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,689
Couldn't do it without my partner, Medusa.

88
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,191
Hey, paper bag girl.

89
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,527
When will they de-fossilize?

90
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,654
Oh, eventually.

91
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,575
-Gotcha! Leave the rest to us!
-Thank you.

92
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,702
Let's go, Orochimaru.

93
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,579
-Where?
-Oh, come on.

94
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,582
I'm gonna make you mine today.

95
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,209
-You're under arrest!
-No way in hell!

96
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,212
-Medusa, help!
-Not my problem.

97
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,966
Bank robber arrest victory!
Now that's Insta-worthy.

98
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,469
Hashtag "no money stolen."

99
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,929
Hashtag "but my heart was."

100
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,973
Hashtag "I love Orochimaru."

101
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,603
I need you! ATM!

102
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,856
You're on your own, deceiver.

103
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,233
The ATMs are over there.

104
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,778
What? You traitor!

105
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,821
I should've known!

106
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:07,284
The number of bank robberies
in Japan peaked in 2001.

107
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,620
Since then, they have decreased.

108
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:14,249
Instead, low-risk crimes like bank transfer scams
have sky-rocketed.

109
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,713
Don't be a victim.
Check-in with your parents frequently.

110
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,008
But history's changed now!

111
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
My bag ripped.

112
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,471
Use this.

113
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,224
Thanks, that's good for now.

114
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:36,021
But nothing tops craft paper bags
when it comes to comfort, texture and smell.

115
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,357
Never knew you were so particular.

116
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,241
It's a new day!

117
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,165
Time to deliver the milk!

118
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,044
MILK

119
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,005
There! That's it for today.

120
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,426
Sweet. I was a second faster than last time!

121
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,557
At this rate, I'll eventually make
a zero-second record!

122
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,308
Oh, I wish!

123
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,979
Seconds, please!

124
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,941
-You've got quite the appetite.
-She's got no shame.

125
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,069
You're just a great cook, Jashin-chan.

126
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,698
I know. No need to say it.

127
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,074
Here you go.

128
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,577
Just like the folktales.

129
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,870
Like this one.

130
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,831
Where does that energy come from?

131
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,209
Never caught a cold as a child either.

132
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,212
They do say that fools never catch colds.

133
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,757
I've never caught a cold either.

134
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,467
Because I'm a fool.

135
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,219
Are you okay on time?

136
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,221
Shoot, I'm gonna be late.

137
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,974
Thanks for breakfast! See you!

138
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,018
Minos works so hard.

139
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,687
The complete opposite of someone I know.

140
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,981
I'm a devoted homemaker.

141
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,736
Here we go.

142
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,113
We're glad to have you here.

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,907
You can count on me.

144
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,535
-It's so heavy...
-Hey, little one!

145
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,037
Me?

146
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,248
Yeah, you! Little one! I'm talking to you.

147
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,001
You're moving too slow.
Wake up, will you?

148
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:25,172
Why do I have to be treated like a slave
in order to survive?

149
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,008
Leave the heavy-lifting to me.

150
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,886
Go get assigned another task.

151
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,679
Thank you so much.

152
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,264
No biggie.

153
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,725
She's so bright.

154
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,478
She is a devil, right?

155
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,234
Another busy day of work all done!

156
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,236
Time to jog back home.

157
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,030
Thanks for--

158
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,205
I couldn't even thank her.
I'm such a loser.

159
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,250
I will next time.

160
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,465
Will I ever get to see Jashin-chan?

161
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,515
-My bad! Are you okay?
-Yes.

162
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,518
Good, I'm glad.

163
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,646
Get home safe.

164
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,398
See you!

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,776
She's a devil!

166
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,780
Wait, do you know Jashin-chan? Hey!

167
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,534
Hey, Minos!

168
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,537
-Let's play cards!
-Play with us.

169
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,790
Sorry, kiddos, I don't have my cards with me.

170
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,542
Really?

171
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,793
That's a bummer.

172
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,838
-Next time, I promise!
-Okay, see you!

173
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,881
-Bye!
-See you later!

174
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,301
Hey, kiddos...

175
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,639
I've got cards we could play with,
what do you say?

176
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,686
No, we're good.

177
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,022
-Let's go, guys.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,692
-We wanted Minos.
-She's got big boobs.

179
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,571
-Minos is really good, too.
-She's got big boobs, too.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,829
What a day today!

181
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,043
Taking a bath after a hard day's work
is the best feeling ever.

182
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,045
Yeah!

183
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,053
Delicious!

184
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,722
I'm ready to do it all again tomorrow!

185
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,605
We're both devils, but why is Minos
more popular with humans? Damn it!

186
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,899
You're better off extinct, humans!

187
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,985
With that attitude, it's no surprise.

188
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,072
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

189
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,241
What do you wanna drink?

190
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,952
-Orange or grapefruit?
-Orange.

191
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,120
All right.

192
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,585
-Here you go.
-That was kind of gross.

193
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,131
Jashin-chan.

194
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,635
How does ramen for lunch sound?

195
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,388
I'm in the mood for rice.

196
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,225
You look like you're lusting for ramen.

197
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,434
But I just said--

198
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,020
You want ramen, right?

199
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,273
Yes, I'd love to eat ramen.

200
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,734
Here we go again.

201
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,528
Welcome!

202
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,782
-Hey you!
-Damn it.

203
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,952
-You know her?
-She almost killed me!

204
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,914
-I'll finish you today!
-Please stop, I don't know you!

205
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,999
-You can't fool me!
-Stop!

206
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,253
-Don't hurt Noel!
-Step away!

207
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,215
What? Noel?
That's not your name.

208
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,011
Noel is a future idol
who works here to support herself!

209
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,597
A sweet girl like her would never kill!

210
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,307
An idol?

211
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,310
They look alike,
but I guess she's not Poporon.

212
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,062
Die!

213
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,815
You're Noel?

214
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,152
Jeez, what a drag.

215
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,863
Yes, I'm Noel Amatsuka.

216
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,073
Pleasure to meet you!

217
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:26,788
Believe it or not, the ramen and fried rice
killer combo originated in Jinbocho.

218
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,666
What would you like today?

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,004
Enough with the nonsense.
Hurry up and order.

220
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,505
That was close.

221
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,591
Coming right up!

222
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,261
I see you hired new staff
since the last time I was here.

223
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,723
Yup, Noel has spiked the traffic here.

224
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,560
-We come here every day.
-Yup!

225
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,770
Thanks for your support!

226
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,900
Today, I'll treat you to stir-fry sprouts
and take it out of my pay.

227
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,281
She's treating us pigs,
using her precious salary!

228
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,366
Thank you so much.
I'm so happy!

229
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,410
Losers.

230
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,873
Human men get way too excited over nothing.

231
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,129
That weird pouch.
That has to be Poporon's.

232
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,756
Let's test her.

233
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,884
Poporon, could I have a refill please?

234
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,636
Right away!

235
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,387
Damn it!

236
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,474
So you are Poporon!

237
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,145
-Stop it! Viper bitch!
-Don't touch our Noel!

238
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,108
Jashin-chan, this is a place
for all of us to sit down and eat.

239
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,612
There's no exception, Jashin-chan.

240
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,780
But she--

241
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,491
Don't point.

242
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,706
Mito Komon is said to be
the first to have ramen in Japan.

243
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:56,002
But another theory suggests it was
a monk during the Muromachi Period.

244
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,256
What you believe is up to you.

245
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,675
Check please.

246
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,052
Okay.

247
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,845
That was very good.

248
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,641
-I'm sorry for all the ruckus.
-Yeah...

249
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,060
We're leaving, Jashin-chan.

250
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:23,530
As Jashin-chan said, you aren't just a human.

251
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,033
You exert the same aura
as another girl I know.

252
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,832
That girl subdued the devil.
She knows who I am, too.

253
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,834
Who the hell is she?

254
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,961
Dropkick on My Devil!

255
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,673
Stationery.

256
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:46,928
Since it has "station" in it,
it must be a military-related defensive weapon.

257
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,471
Hey, Yurine.

258
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,267
I wanna test my defense powers,
so attack me.

259
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,476
Sure thing.

260
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,186
Now, come at me!

261
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,568
Completely useless.

262
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,987
You're such an idiot.

263
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,539
I can't suppress this craving for pudding.

264
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,632
There you are.

265
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,351
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

266
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,898
After my first bite of pudding
in the human world,

267
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,317
I was instantly addicted.

268
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,654
To the point where I suffer withdrawal symptoms.

269
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,240
So good! It's too good!

270
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,160
It permeates through my brain!

271
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:57,123
There are no other sweets
that have this effect on me!

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,129
YURINE

273
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,842
Damn it!

274
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,387
This was Yurine's pudding!

275
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,763
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

276
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,141
I need to buy another one
before she gets back!

277
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,185
I'm home.

278
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,481
What's wrong?
Is it the end of the world?

279
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,944
It is for me. Everything was clear
before it all fell apart.

280
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,448
Hey, you ate my pudding.

281
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,368
The invisible one.

282
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,663
The invisible one.

283
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,041
Watch out!
There's an invisible one lurking around!

284
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,377
There's the culprit!

285
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,547
I'm gonna get you!
It just punched me!

286
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,841
Damn you, invisible one!

287
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,802
Take this! Royal Copenha--

288
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,931
I won't let you get away with this!

289
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,058
Damn it, it escaped.

290
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,020
I wonder how it escaped
when the window is closed.

291
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,398
Oh, well...

292
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,734
That's because...

293
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,652
It went through it?

294
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,280
How do you see it when it's invisible?

295
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,950
Because... it's from hell?

296
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,119
I see.

297
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,414
-You have pudding on your lips.
-What?

298
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,374
Coming.

299
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,543
Delivery!

300
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:28,757
It must be from brawling
with the invisible one just now.

301
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,094
-My order's here.
-Your order?

302
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,805
What did you order?

303
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,308
An iron maiden.

304
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,854
If you were honest about it,
you could've just bought another one.

305
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,358
But you chose to mock me
with a lame game of charades.

306
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,117
Get me out of here!

307
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,287
You better come out before
you run out of blood.

308
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,373
I don't really have a choice, do I?

309
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,083
No!

310
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,070
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

311
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,866
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

312
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,038
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

313
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:46,584
As she starves to death

314
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,128
It's a love and hate relationship

315
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,422
Can't leave each other alone

316
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,052
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

317
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:00,265
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

318
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,684
Test my heart, don't stop

319
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:09,774
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

320
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:14,153
We're a happy family

321
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,283
Let me say, I love you

322
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,743
When all is said and done

323
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:25,331
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

324
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,086
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

325
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,338
For another crazy tomorrow

326
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,050
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

327
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,933
Nobody is out here because of the fog.

328
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,449
-What the hell was that?
-Jashin-chan, help!

329
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,578
Medusa, what's going--?

330
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,999
Zombies?

331
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,383
Over here! Medusa, hurry up! Run!

332
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,677
Wait!

333
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,724
It's locked!

334
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,019
Damn it, who would lock it?

335
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,188
Jashin-chan, look!

336
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,190
Nice find, Medusa.

337
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,082
-Jashin-chan.
-What is it?

338
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,086
Here's some light.

339
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,588
Hey, it's too bright.

340
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,426
I'll turn it off so they won't catch us.

341
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,311
-Let's hide in here.
-Okay.

342
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,362
Come out. Orochimaru.

343
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,495
Orochimaru...

344
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,813
You guys okay in there?

345
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,149
Minos, you saved us!

346
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,527
It's not safe here.
They're gathered in the back.

347
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:03,156
-Should we go outside, then?
-That's risky, too.

348
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,908
The fog's too thick to see anything.

349
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,994
Then where should we go?

350
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,912
Come with me.

351
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,184
Run for your life!

352
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,688
-We're doomed!
-Over here!

353
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,649
It's a dead end!

354
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,278
This door is locked, too!

355
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,324
Please! Someone, open the door!

356
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,743
Please!

357
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,247
-It's a sliding door.
-Yurine!

358
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,458
Oh, whoops.

359
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,127
-Hurry, Medusa!
-Help!

360
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,716
Hey, don't abandon me! Help!

361
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,595
Medusa! Minos! Save me, please!

362
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,597
Someone please!

363
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,310
Jashin-chan.

364
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,730
Are you okay?
You were having a nightmare.

365
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,233
I'm fine.

366
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,361
Please don't scream
in middle of the night.

367
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,196
Okay, I won't.

368
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,364
KONNYAKU

369
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:33,579
If you place a damp towel on someone's feet
while they're asleep,

370
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,416
they're more prone to nightmares!

371
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,131
The evil preys on the good-hearted.

372
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,092
An angel of sorrow rises up against them.

373
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,845
What does the angel want to protect?

374
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,305
Dropkick on My Devil!

375
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,475
Next time, a single-winged angel
will steal your heart!

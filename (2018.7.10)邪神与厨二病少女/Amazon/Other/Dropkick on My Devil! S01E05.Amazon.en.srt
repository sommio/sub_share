1
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:04,025
Your total is 3200 yen.

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,822
Why don't they have the volume two
of the grimoire?

3
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:13,534
I bought that volume one
at a used book store.

4
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:16,079
You're just looking
in the wrong place.

5
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:19,958
I'm happy with my purchase.

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,584
It's Yurine.

7
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,086
DROPKICK ON MY DEVIL!
ANIMATED SERIES TO START

8
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:25,088
USING GRIMOIRE FROM USED BOOK STORE TO
PERFORM CONJURATION.

9
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:26,506
It's true...

10
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:28,466
Aren't you hungry?

11
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,593
Let's grab a bite somewhere.

12
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,011
What do you want?

13
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:33,596
Yurine!

14
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:35,556
What? Me?

15
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,767
I wanna go to Jiro.

16
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:41,145
Let's go to Jiro.

17
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,898
Then why ask in the first place?

18
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,276
What's Jiro, anyway?

19
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,695
And... is it true?

20
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:50,738
We're an anime series?

21
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:52,282
Get with it, girl!

22
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:57,287
Won’t leave

23
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:03,084
without a dropkick on her!

24
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,215
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

25
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:24,188
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

26
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:26,774
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

27
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,651
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

28
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:32,363
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

29
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,282
If you go too far,

30
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:38,286
I’ll slice you up completely!

31
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,496
Your halo!
Must get it back!

32
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:44,625
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

33
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:48,838
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

34
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:53,134
I’ll never give up.

35
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:54,719
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

36
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:58,931
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

37
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,851
Huh? What? I missed...

38
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:05,271
Can’t leave Earth

39
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,318
without a dropkick on her!

40
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,571
But until then,

41
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:19,494
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

42
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:23,664
KITCHEN JIRO

43
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:24,916
Welcome.

44
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,754
You always order the fried minced meat
with fried fish plate.

45
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:33,674
It's my favorite!
And look who's talking.

46
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,386
You always get the scallop croquette plate.

47
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,015
Well, yeah, it's my favorite.

48
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,645
I want a bite of that.

49
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:47,563
No way.

50
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:52,276
I don't believe in sharing
or letting people try my food.

51
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:58,032
Just be happy with what you ordered.

52
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,911
Sorry, never mind.

53
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,541
I can't finish the rice.

54
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,584
Jashin-chan, eat the rest.

55
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,129
Okay...

56
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,507
She just contradicted herself.

57
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,844
But, if I say anything she'll get mad.
I'll just let it slide...

58
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:23,182
That was delicious.

59
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:28,521
Excuse me. I'd like to order
the fried minced meat lunch set.

60
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,315
Right away!

61
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,193
What are you gonna do with that?

62
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:35,695
Is it for dinner?

63
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,156
I need to stop by somewhere.

64
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,665
Pekola, are you here?
I got food for you.

65
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,251
Why take care
of that fallen angel?

66
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,836
Pekola?

67
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:54,589
I'm not Pekola.

68
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,507
Whoops, wrong one.

69
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,468
Pekola's over there.

70
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:02,346
I see. Thank you.

71
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:07,477
The witch and her familiar spirit.
What do you want?

72
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,729
How rude.

73
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,148
I could kill you if I wanted to.

74
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:16,277
Stop! Since I lost my halo
not only am I weak,

75
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:20,406
I'm also starving to death.
I can barely move.

76
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,202
That's why I brought you this.

77
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,414
A fried minced meat lunch set?

78
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:32,335
For me...?

79
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:39,383
No! As an angel,
I can't accept food from a witch!

80
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,594
Please go home.

81
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,804
Just so you know, I'm not a witch.

82
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,975
Do what you want.

83
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,354
I'll just leave this here.

84
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,735
Let's go, Jashin-chan.

85
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,028
Okay.

86
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,046
I want it so bad!

87
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,215
No! I can't!

88
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:23,052
What angel accepts food
from a witch?

89
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:29,392
But, I can't just let the food
go to waste either.

90
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,727
Never mind the witch,

91
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:35,606
wouldn't it be disrespectful
to the chef if I didn't eat it?

92
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,776
Right! I'll eat it for the chef!

93
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:39,986
Bon appetit!

94
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:41,153
THIS IS PEKOLA'S IMAGINATION

95
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,197
All right! Let's eat!

96
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,704
Smells so good...

97
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,709
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:56,502 --> 00:06:00,047
Since you weren't gonna eat it,
thought I'd eat it for you.

99
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,716
Didn't want to waste it!

100
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:09,307
What? Did you want to eat it?

101
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:11,851
Of course not.

102
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,352
Good.

103
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,572
That was the last bite.

104
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,368
So juicy and delicious!

105
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:35,124
That meat was to die for!
I know, I'm not the best food reporter...

106
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,627
All done! Here, throw this away.

107
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,796
I'm so satisfied!

108
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:44,508
Jeez, my stomach's a bottomless pit.

109
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:49,388
That's okay.

110
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,433
I was able to protect my dignity
as an angel.

111
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:58,272
I'll drink some water
and go to bed.

112
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:02,943
Patrasche, I'm tired now.

113
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,744
HOURS LATER

114
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,207
You disappeared
on the way back home.

115
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:20,503
Don't tell me you went back
and ate Pekola's food.

116
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,005
No. I didn't eat it.

117
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,466
-Are you sure?
-Yeah!

118
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:29,011
If you don't tell me the truth...

119
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,977
I'll mince your arm
into pieces.

120
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,355
Yeah! I ate it! I ate it!

121
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:46,987
We'll serve fried Jashin-chan meat
for dinner tonight.

122
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:50,074
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

123
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:54,995
I'm gonna go to Jiro to get
Pekola some food again.

124
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,998
So, restore your arm
and clean up the mess. Okay?

125
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,795
Damn it.

126
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,256
I even told her the truth.

127
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:07,341
Damn it!

128
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,301
PIPING HOT
FRIED MINCED MEAT

129
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:19,687
Bless the witch!

130
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:25,109
Hello!

131
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:32,825
I brought something cool
from Hell for you.

132
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,994
Check out the Mandragora doll!

133
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:38,247
Also known as the mandrake.

134
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:42,084
Legend says anyone
who pulls them out

135
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:45,713
and hears their screams
goes mad and dies!

136
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:50,176
You press the stomach
to hear its death scream.

137
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,552
Listen.

138
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,723
That's freaky.

139
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,684
That's so metal.

140
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,394
So lame.

141
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,354
-Like it?
-Yup.

142
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,941
Good. The Mandragora's happy too.

143
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:07,985
Jashin-chan is such a sleaze.

144
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:11,822
But her friends, Medusa and Minos,
are so nice.

145
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,991
Even though Jashin-chan's such a jerk.

146
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:17,828
She's not even my friend anyway.

147
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,538
Hey, that's not nice.

148
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,207
What?

149
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,668
Do you have any idea how many
times I got hurt because of you?

150
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,214
-I'll push you, Jashin-chan!
-What?

151
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,715
Here you go!

152
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,471
Let's play some more!

153
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:38,057
Leave me alone.

154
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:41,602
Come on, let's go!

155
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,896
What's going on?

156
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:46,315
I dislocated my back...

157
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:53,864
I apologized right then and there.
It wasn't on purpose either.

158
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,408
That's not the point!

159
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,494
You gotta be more careful!

160
00:09:58,661 --> 00:09:59,745
You meathead!

161
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:03,165
What? This is all because you're so weak!

162
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,002
What? I'm not weak! Try me!

163
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,337
Let's do it.

164
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:10,464
I'll show you!

165
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:13,717
Take this! Jashin-chan Dropkick!

166
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:16,762
The animation!

167
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:18,097
Go!

168
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:21,392
You think I'm scared of that?

169
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,621
Hey, Mandragora...

170
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:48,294
NO RESPONSE.
IT'S PROBABLY DEAD.

171
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,755
That was its real death scream.

172
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,717
Oh, well.

173
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,427
It was freaky anyway.

174
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,512
Right, Yurine?

175
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,474
I was getting pretty attached to it.

176
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:05,185
Yurine?

177
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:09,982
Well, I gotta go deliver the evening paper.
See you later.

178
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,859
Minos, you traitor!

179
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:15,279
The death scream...

180
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:17,364
I thought it was pretty cute.

181
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,784
It's a rare toy too.

182
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,914
Need I say more?

183
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,711
There we go.

184
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:34,506
Oh, come on. Give me a better scream.

185
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:38,052
The Mandragora's death scream
was way better than that.

186
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,554
Stop... I can't do it...

187
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:46,185
Scream loud and clear.

188
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,525
No matter how hard I work,

189
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,945
life just gets harder and harder.

190
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:57,863
I'll just stare at my hand.

191
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,115
Working is fun!

192
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,618
You work, you lose.

193
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:05,162
I'll just stare at my hand.

194
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,595
Good morning, mascot of India.

195
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:25,641
How's the new room, Totem Pole?

196
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:27,518
Bus-tine.

197
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:31,814
It took a lot of effort
to get you here.

198
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:36,777
I love how the bus schedule
is posted right there.

199
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,488
You're my precious babies.

200
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:44,451
I just need Orochimaru
to complete my collection.

201
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:48,288
Shoot! I'm gonna be late!

202
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,548
I, Mei Tachibana, the super cop of the Banzaibashi Police
will protect this land from all evil!

203
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:06,265
I must stay on high alert for weirdos
while I'm on patrol.

204
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:15,733
Are you okay?

205
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,401
I'm fine.

206
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:20,404
I just have a weak body.

207
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:24,366
Excuse me.

208
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,912
She had such a cute voice.

209
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:31,415
All clear.

210
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,626
Excuse me, sir.

211
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:37,004
Are you interested in woodblock prints?

212
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:38,756
Woodblock prints?

213
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:42,426
They're a bit pricey,
but you can pay in installments.

214
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,262
It'll be a good investment
for your future.

215
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,516
Let me show you.

216
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,394
Sure.

217
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,606
-I'll just take a look.
-One silkscreen please!

218
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,233
GALLERY

219
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,027
NEGOTIATING

220
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,154
Yup, all clear.

221
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:11,955
How wonderful!

222
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:16,877
I love his form and his wacky
Halloween-ish outfit.

223
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:21,256
He's so beautiful, I'm tearing up.

224
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,718
I'm going to take him home.

225
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,096
Here we go.

226
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,723
Excuse me.

227
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:33,769
Is there a problem with that figure?

228
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:37,106
Did someone plant a bomb on it?

229
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,485
No, I'm taking him home
because he's so cute.

230
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,323
He wants to go home with me too, right?

231
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:47,658
"Yes, I do."

232
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,034
See?

233
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,577
What a freak.

234
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,288
I better call the police.

235
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:56,875
But wait, is she a cop?
I'm so confused.

236
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,086
I'm just a part-timer.

237
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,255
What am I supposed to do?

238
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:02,631
Let's go!

239
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:06,093
Wait! You can't take our mascot!

240
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:09,054
-Did you just touch my butt?
-What?

241
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,933
He's a pervert!
Someone call the cops! Help!

242
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:15,227
I didn't touch you!

243
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,979
I'm taking him home.

244
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,523
Let go, you freak.

245
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:23,819
-It's that freak from the other day.
-This belongs to the shop.

246
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,825
I was meeting up with Medusa,
but I can't let her see me.

247
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,618
Jashin-chan!

248
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,831
Jashin-chan? Orochimaru!

249
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:38,041
Were you waiting for a while?

250
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,502
I bought you some chicken.

251
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:41,962
What's wrong?

252
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,215
Forget this! I want Orochimaru!

253
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,343
Damn it! She saw me!

254
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,388
Orochimaru! Wait, my dear!

255
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:54,808
I have to get away from her!

256
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:58,312
Jeez, slow down!

257
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,898
What's going on?

258
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:02,858
Did you do something?

259
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,485
You have to make up for your crimes.

260
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:07,237
Shut up!

261
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,951
Orochimaru!

262
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:19,166
Bull's-eye!

263
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,919
Jashin-chan! Are you okay?

264
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,795
Not at all.

265
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,255
I LOVE OROCHIMARU

266
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,425
Gotcha!

267
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,845
Oh, Orochimaru.

268
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,265
So beautiful... So cute...

269
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:37,142
So smooth.

270
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,352
Stop it!

271
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:42,648
Orochimaru's the best!

272
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:45,817
Time for our celebratory selfie!

273
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:49,238
Stop! I can't!

274
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,827
JASHIN-CHAN DOUBLE PEACE

275
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,496
Nice shot!

276
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,255
Everything looks delicious.

277
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,883
Pekola, don't forget about dessert.

278
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:11,677
Have some nectar too.

279
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:12,844
ANGEL IN TRAINING

280
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:16,515
This is so much food.

281
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:22,646
Steak, onion soup...

282
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:26,024
Parfait, cake, unleavened bread...

283
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,151
Bagna cauda...

284
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:29,444
-Tiramisu...
-Hey!

285
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,406
-Fried minced meat...
-Hey, wake up!

286
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:35,367
I'm talking to you, part-timer!

287
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,287
Me?

288
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,622
You're here to work.

289
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:43,208
Don't daydream while you're on the clock.

290
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,627
Come on, move it.

291
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,464
Why do I get treated like this?

292
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:52,342
I was an angel, you know?

293
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:57,764
We're forced to climb up the stairs
with heavy loads on our backs.

294
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,225
Are we building a pyramid
or something?

295
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:05,981
We climb up the stairs
and go back down in an elevator.

296
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:09,484
How much longer will I last?

297
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:12,029
For 400 yen per hour?

298
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:15,824
Why is it so low?

299
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,493
Isn't Tokyo's minimum wage 958 yen?

300
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:23,248
But, I have to do this to survive.

301
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:29,254
No other place would hire me
without a background check.

302
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:33,759
There. That was heavy.

303
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:36,553
What could possibly be in there?

304
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:40,515
Hurry up and carry the next load,
part-timer!

305
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:44,644
That guy really sounds like an idiot.

306
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:45,812
DOESN'T SOUND INTELLIGENT AT ALL

307
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:54,196
Is it just me, or are we doing all of this backwards?

308
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:02,079
The theory of relativity
and warp navigation

309
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:06,083
parallels the relationship
between dark matter and black holes...

310
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,211
So, that means...

311
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:14,591
What have I gotten myself into?
This is bad. Really, really bad.

312
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:23,892
This one seems normal.

313
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:29,898
The giant mantis...

314
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:33,527
He's coming to kill me!

315
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,447
Stop. Don't come near me!

316
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,616
Stay away!

317
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:44,454
Praying mantis...

318
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:49,543
Trust me!
You won't like how I taste!

319
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,926
The giant mantis...

320
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,762
Mantis...

321
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:04,891
Praying mantis!

322
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,394
Oh, no. Praying mantis...

323
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:13,692
I'm so tipsy.

324
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:16,945
Hey, fallen angel.

325
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:19,906
Sushi's a rare delicacy for you, right?

326
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,826
It's actually for Yurine,

327
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:26,037
but I could feed you
a couple pieces.

328
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:46,266
LAYING ON TOP OF HER THROW UP.

329
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,607
I'm beat.

330
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,985
It is nice that they pay in cash.

331
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:01,615
But I only got 3200 yen
for eight straight hours of work.

332
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:05,785
I'll spend 1000 yen for food
and necessities

333
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:09,247
and put 2200 in my savings.

334
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,585
I need to get some sleep
in order to do this again tomorrow.

335
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,677
My house!

336
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:25,805
You again?

337
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:35,815
After slaving all day,

338
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,777
the devil destroys my home.

339
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:42,906
Nobody's coming for me from Heaven.

340
00:21:44,824 --> 00:21:46,117
I'm...

341
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,203
I'm...

342
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,516
Whoa, a shooting star!

343
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:34,624
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

344
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:39,546
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

345
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,884
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

346
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:49,306
As she starves to death!

347
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:51,933
It’s a love and hate relationship,

348
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,144
can’t leave each other alone

349
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,815
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

350
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:02,986
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

351
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,405
Test my heart, don’t stop

352
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:12,495
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

353
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:16,708
We’re a happy family La la la

354
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:21,004
Let me say, I love you!!

355
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,465
When all is said and done

356
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:28,136
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

357
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:32,807
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

358
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:35,101
For another crazy tomorrow

359
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:38,772
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

360
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,068
Gospel echoes.

361
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,155

1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,379
Your total is 3200 yen.

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:09,176
Why don't they have the volume two
of the grimoire?

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,888
I bought that volume one
at a used book store.

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,474
You're just looking
in the wrong place.

5
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,353
I'm happy with my purchase.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,938
It's Yurine.

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,481
DROPKICK ON MY DEVIL!
ANIMATED SERIES TO START

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,483
USING GRIMOIRE FROM USED BOOK STORE TO
PERFORM CONJURATION.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,901
It's true...

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,820
Aren't you hungry?

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,947
Let's grab a bite somewhere.

12
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,365
What do you want?

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,992
Yurine!

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,952
What? Me?

15
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,163
I wanna go to Jiro.

16
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,541
Let's go to Jiro.

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,294
Then why ask in the first place?

18
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,671
What's Jiro, anyway?

19
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,090
And... is it true?

20
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,134
We're an anime series?

21
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,635
Get with it, girl!

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,682
Won’t leave

23
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:02,438
without a dropkick on her!

24
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,611
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

25
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,584
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

26
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,128
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

27
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,005
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

28
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,717
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

29
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,636
If you go too far,

30
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,640
I’ll slice you up completely!

31
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,892
Your halo!
Must get it back!

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,021
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

33
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,234
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

34
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,488
I’ll never give up.

35
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,114
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

36
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,285
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

37
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,205
Huh? What? I missed...

38
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,625
Can’t leave Earth

39
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:09,713
without a dropkick on her!

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,925
But until then,

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:18,848
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

42
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,018
KITCHEN JIRO

43
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,270
Welcome.

44
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:29,108
You always order the fried minced meat
with fried fish plate.

45
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,028
It's my favorite!
And look who's talking.

46
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,739
You always get the scallop croquette plate.

47
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,411
Well, yeah, it's my favorite.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,040
I want a bite of that.

49
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,917
No way.

50
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,672
I don't believe in sharing
or letting people try my food.

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,386
Just be happy with what you ordered.

52
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,265
Sorry, never mind.

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,895
I can't finish the rice.

54
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,938
Jashin-chan, eat the rest.

55
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,524
Okay...

56
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,903
She just contradicted herself.

57
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
But, if I say anything she'll get mad.
I'll just let it slide...

58
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,536
That was delicious.

59
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,875
Excuse me. I'd like to order
the fried minced meat lunch set.

60
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,669
Right away!

61
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,547
What are you gonna do with that?

62
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,090
Is it for dinner?

63
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,551
I need to stop by somewhere.

64
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,061
Pekola, are you here?
I got food for you.

65
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,605
Why take care
of that fallen angel?

66
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,190
Pekola?

67
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,984
I'm not Pekola.

68
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,903
Whoops, wrong one.

69
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,863
Pekola's over there.

70
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,742
I see. Thank you.

71
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,872
The witch and her familiar spirit.
What do you want?

72
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,124
How rude.

73
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,543
I could kill you if I wanted to.

74
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,673
Stop! Since I lost my halo
not only am I weak,

75
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,802
I'm also starving to death.
I can barely move.

76
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,555
That's why I brought you this.

77
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,768
A fried minced meat lunch set?

78
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,730
For me...?

79
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:38,737
No! As an angel,
I can't accept food from a witch!

80
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,948
Please go home.

81
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,200
Just so you know, I'm not a witch.

82
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,371
Do what you want.

83
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,708
I'll just leave this here.

84
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,131
Let's go, Jashin-chan.

85
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,424
Okay.

86
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,442
I want it so bad!

87
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,569
No! I can't!

88
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,406
What angel accepts food
from a witch?

89
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,746
But, I can't just let the food
go to waste either.

90
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,123
Never mind the witch,

91
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,002
wouldn't it be disrespectful
to the chef if I didn't eat it?

92
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,172
Right! I'll eat it for the chef!

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,339
Bon appetit!

94
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,507
THIS IS PEKOLA'S IMAGINATION

95
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,593
All right! Let's eat!

96
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,058
Smells so good...

97
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,104
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,443
Since you weren't gonna eat it,
thought I'd eat it for you.

99
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,111
Didn't want to waste it!

100
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,702
What? Did you want to eat it?

101
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,205
Of course not.

102
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,706
Good.

103
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,926
That was the last bite.

104
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,764
So juicy and delicious!

105
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:34,478
That meat was to die for!
I know, I'm not the best food reporter...

106
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,022
All done! Here, throw this away.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,192
I'm so satisfied!

108
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,904
Jeez, my stomach's a bottomless pit.

109
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,784
That's okay.

110
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,787
I was able to protect my dignity
as an angel.

111
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,626
I'll drink some water
and go to bed.

112
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,297
Patrasche, I'm tired now.

113
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,098
HOURS LATER

114
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,602
You disappeared
on the way back home.

115
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,857
Don't tell me you went back
and ate Pekola's food.

116
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,359
No. I didn't eat it.

117
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,862
-Are you sure?
-Yeah!

118
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,365
If you don't tell me the truth...

119
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,373
I'll mince your arm
into pieces.

120
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,709
Yeah! I ate it! I ate it!

121
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:46,383
We'll serve fried Jashin-chan meat
for dinner tonight.

122
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,428
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

123
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:54,349
I'm gonna go to Jiro to get
Pekola some food again.

124
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,394
So, restore your arm
and clean up the mess. Okay?

125
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,149
Damn it.

126
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,651
I even told her the truth.

127
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,695
Damn it!

128
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,655
PIPING HOT
FRIED MINCED MEAT

129
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,082
Bless the witch!

130
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
Hello!

131
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,179
I brought something cool
from Hell for you.

132
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,348
Check out the Mandragora doll!

133
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,643
Also known as the mandrake.

134
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,438
Legend says anyone
who pulls them out

135
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,067
and hears their screams
goes mad and dies!

136
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,571
You press the stomach
to hear its death scream.

137
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,906
Listen.

138
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,077
That's freaky.

139
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,038
That's so metal.

140
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,748
So lame.

141
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,708
-Like it?
-Yup.

142
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,295
Good. The Mandragora's happy too.

143
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,339
Jashin-chan is such a sleaze.

144
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:11,176
But her friends, Medusa and Minos,
are so nice.

145
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,345
Even though Jashin-chan's such a jerk.

146
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,224
She's not even my friend anyway.

147
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,934
Hey, that's not nice.

148
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,602
What?

149
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:24,064
Do you have any idea how many
times I got hurt because of you?

150
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,567
-I'll push you, Jashin-chan!
-What?

151
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,069
Here you go!

152
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,825
Let's play some more!

153
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,452
Leave me alone.

154
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,956
Come on, let's go!

155
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,292
What's going on?

156
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,669
I dislocated my back...

157
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,218
I apologized right then and there.
It wasn't on purpose either.

158
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,804
That's not the point!

159
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,848
You gotta be more careful!

160
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,099
You meathead!

161
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,519
What? This is all because you're so weak!

162
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,356
What? I'm not weak! Try me!

163
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,733
Let's do it.

164
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,818
I'll show you!

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,113
Take this! Jashin-chan Dropkick!

166
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,116
The animation!

167
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,492
Go!

168
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,746
You think I'm scared of that?

169
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,975
Hey, Mandragora...

170
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,647
NO RESPONSE.
IT'S PROBABLY DEAD.

171
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,151
That was its real death scream.

172
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,112
Oh, well.

173
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,822
It was freaky anyway.

174
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,866
Right, Yurine?

175
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,870
I was getting pretty attached to it.

176
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,539
Yurine?

177
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,336
Well, I gotta go deliver the evening paper.
See you later.

178
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,254
Minos, you traitor!

179
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,674
The death scream...

180
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,718
I thought it was pretty cute.

181
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,138
It's a rare toy too.

182
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,267
Need I say more?

183
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,065
There we go.

184
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,902
Oh, come on. Give me a better scream.

185
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,406
The Mandragora's death scream
was way better than that.

186
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,908
Stop... I can't do it...

187
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,539
Scream loud and clear.

188
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,879
No matter how hard I work,

189
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,340
life just gets harder and harder.

190
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,217
I'll just stare at my hand.

191
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,511
Working is fun!

192
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,013
You work, you lose.

193
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,516
I'll just stare at my hand.

194
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,991
Good morning, mascot of India.

195
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,995
How's the new room, Totem Pole?

196
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,913
Bus-tine.

197
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,168
It took a lot of effort
to get you here.

198
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,173
I love how the bus schedule
is posted right there.

199
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,884
You're my precious babies.

200
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,805
I just need Orochimaru
to complete my collection.

201
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,684
Shoot! I'm gonna be late!

202
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:56,943
I, Mei Tachibana, the super cop of the Banzaibashi Police
will protect this land from all evil!

203
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,619
I must stay on high alert for weirdos
while I'm on patrol.

204
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,086
Are you okay?

205
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,755
I'm fine.

206
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,758
I just have a weak body.

207
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,762
Excuse me.

208
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,266
She had such a cute voice.

209
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,810
All clear.

210
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,022
Excuse me, sir.

211
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,358
Are you interested in woodblock prints?

212
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,109
Woodblock prints?

213
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,780
They're a bit pricey,
but you can pay in installments.

214
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,616
It'll be a good investment
for your future.

215
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,912
Let me show you.

216
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,748
Sure.

217
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,960
-I'll just take a look.
-One silkscreen please!

218
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,587
GALLERY

219
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,422
NEGOTIATING

220
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,508
Yup, all clear.

221
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,309
How wonderful!

222
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:16,273
I love his form and his wacky
Halloween-ish outfit.

223
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,652
He's so beautiful, I'm tearing up.

224
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,114
I'm going to take him home.

225
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,449
Here we go.

226
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,077
Excuse me.

227
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,164
Is there a problem with that figure?

228
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,501
Did someone plant a bomb on it?

229
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,839
No, I'm taking him home
because he's so cute.

230
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,677
He wants to go home with me too, right?

231
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,053
"Yes, I do."

232
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,388
See?

233
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,973
What a freak.

234
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,684
I better call the police.

235
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,229
But wait, is she a cop?
I'm so confused.

236
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm just a part-timer.

237
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,650
What am I supposed to do?

238
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,985
Let's go!

239
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,447
Wait! You can't take our mascot!

240
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,408
-Did you just touch my butt?
-What?

241
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,287
He's a pervert!
Someone call the cops! Help!

242
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,623
I didn't touch you!

243
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,374
I'm taking him home.

244
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,877
Let go, you freak.

245
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,214
-It's that freak from the other day.
-This belongs to the shop.

246
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:29,179
I was meeting up with Medusa,
but I can't let her see me.

247
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,014
Jashin-chan!

248
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,185
Jashin-chan? Orochimaru!

249
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,395
Were you waiting for a while?

250
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,856
I bought you some chicken.

251
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,316
What's wrong?

252
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,569
Forget this! I want Orochimaru!

253
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,697
Damn it! She saw me!

254
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,784
Orochimaru! Wait, my dear!

255
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,204
I have to get away from her!

256
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,666
Jeez, slow down!

257
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,293
What's going on?

258
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,253
Did you do something?

259
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,881
You have to make up for your crimes.

260
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,633
Shut up!

261
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:12,305
Orochimaru!

262
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,561
Bull's-eye!

263
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,314
Jashin-chan! Are you okay?

264
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,191
Not at all.

265
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,609
I LOVE OROCHIMARU

266
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,821
Gotcha!

267
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,241
Oh, Orochimaru.

268
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,661
So beautiful... So cute...

269
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,496
So smooth.

270
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,706
Stop it!

271
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,043
Orochimaru's the best!

272
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,213
Time for our celebratory selfie!

273
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,633
Stop! I can't!

274
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,223
JASHIN-CHAN DOUBLE PEACE

275
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,891
Nice shot!

276
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,608
Everything looks delicious.

277
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,237
Pekola, don't forget about dessert.

278
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,072
Have some nectar too.

279
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,240
ANGEL IN TRAINING

280
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,869
This is so much food.

281
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,000
Steak, onion soup...

282
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,378
Parfait, cake, unleavened bread...

283
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,505
Bagna cauda...

284
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,798
-Tiramisu...
-Hey!

285
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,801
-Fried minced meat...
-Hey, wake up!

286
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,763
I'm talking to you, part-timer!

287
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,682
Me?

288
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,976
You're here to work.

289
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,604
Don't daydream while you're on the clock.

290
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,023
Come on, move it.

291
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,818
Why do I get treated like this?

292
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,696
I was an angel, you know?

293
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,118
We're forced to climb up the stairs
with heavy loads on our backs.

294
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,621
Are we building a pyramid
or something?

295
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:05,335
We climb up the stairs
and go back down in an elevator.

296
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,838
How much longer will I last?

297
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,424
For 400 yen per hour?

298
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,178
Why is it so low?

299
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,847
Isn't Tokyo's minimum wage 958 yen?

300
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,644
But, I have to do this to survive.

301
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,608
No other place would hire me
without a background check.

302
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,154
There. That was heavy.

303
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,907
What could possibly be in there?

304
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,869
Hurry up and carry the next load,
part-timer!

305
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,998
That guy really sounds like an idiot.

306
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,166
DOESN'T SOUND INTELLIGENT AT ALL

307
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:53,591
Is it just me, or are we doing all of this backwards?

308
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,474
The theory of relativity
and warp navigation

309
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,436
parallels the relationship
between dark matter and black holes...

310
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,565
So, that means...

311
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:13,945
What have I gotten myself into?
This is bad. Really, really bad.

312
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,246
This one seems normal.

313
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,294
The giant mantis...

314
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,922
He's coming to kill me!

315
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,843
Stop. Don't come near me!

316
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,012
Stay away!

317
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,808
Praying mantis...

318
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,897
Trust me!
You won't like how I taste!

319
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,322
The giant mantis...

320
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,116
Mantis...

321
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,245
Praying mantis!

322
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,748
Oh, no. Praying mantis...

323
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,046
I'm so tipsy.

324
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,341
Hey, fallen angel.

325
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,302
Sushi's a rare delicacy for you, right?

326
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,221
It's actually for Yurine,

327
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,433
but I could feed you
a couple pieces.

328
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,662
LAYING ON TOP OF HER THROW UP.

329
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,002
I'm beat.

330
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,339
It is nice that they pay in cash.

331
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:01,010
But I only got 3200 yen
for eight straight hours of work.

332
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,139
I'll spend 1000 yen for food
and necessities

333
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,643
and put 2200 in my savings.

334
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,981
I need to get some sleep
in order to do this again tomorrow.

335
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,073
My house!

336
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,159
You again?

337
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,169
After slaving all day,

338
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,172
the devil destroys my home.

339
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,301
Nobody's coming for me from Heaven.

340
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,513
I'm...

341
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,557
I'm...

342
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,911
Whoa, a shooting star!

343
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,978
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

344
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,900
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

345
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,238
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

346
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:48,659
As she starves to death!

347
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,287
It’s a love and hate relationship,

348
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,498
can’t leave each other alone

349
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:58,169
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

350
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:02,381
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

351
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,759
Test my heart, don’t stop

352
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:11,849
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

353
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,104
We’re a happy family La la la

354
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,358
Let me say, I love you!!

355
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,819
When all is said and done

356
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:27,532
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

357
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:32,203
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

358
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,455
For another crazy tomorrow

359
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,126
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

360
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,463
Gospel echoes.

361
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,550

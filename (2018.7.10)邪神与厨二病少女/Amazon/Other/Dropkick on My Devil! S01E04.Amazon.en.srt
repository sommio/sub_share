1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,630
Won’t leave

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,386
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,559
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,584
If you go too far,

9
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,588
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,969
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,182
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,436
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,062
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,661
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,873
But until then,

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

21
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,764
Once a post-World War II
black market,

22
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:42,228
it has since evolved into an electronics
then computer district,

23
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,398
and now flourishes today
as the mecca of otaku.

24
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,818
This is Akihabara.

25
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,071
You'll find more than
400 Gachapon machines here.

26
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,072
GACHAPON HALL

27
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,783
You won't be able to resist
the urge to play!

28
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,037
If this comes out next, I'll die.

29
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,588
My life's spared. But a skyfish? Lame!

30
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:15,594
But, boy, I can't get enough
of that adrenaline rush putting my life on the line!

31
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,097
It's not like I'm really gonna die anyway.

32
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,186
I don't need any more of you.

33
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,230
What in the--?

34
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,026
You bastard! Can't you see
this devil lying in the street?

35
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,196
You might as well drive into a pole and die!

36
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,825
Hello, everyone, please do not
lie down in the street

37
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,828
and shout obscenities in public.

38
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,538
Damn it, another double!

39
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,415
Burn in Hell!

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,796
I just need that rare Tsuchinoko
and my collection's complete.

41
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,264
Nope. Not interested in the actual, physical one.

42
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,894
We can't have pets in Yurine's apartment.

43
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,396
Beth being an exception, of course.

44
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,065
Let's try this again.

45
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,029
I only have enough to buy dinner.

46
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,282
But, let's live it up...

47
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,201
Don't you dare waste that money.

48
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,704
If you do, I'll throw you in the wood chipper.

49
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,290
Throw you in the woodchipper...

50
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,833
Woodchipper...?

51
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,884
Woodchippers grind wood
into smaller woodchips.

52
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,595
One mistake using it, and you're on your way to hell!

53
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,931
Speak of the devil...

54
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:48,646
If I spend this money, I'm dead.
I give up.

55
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,397
Excuse me...

56
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,401
-I wanna do that one.
-Go ahead.

57
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,613
"I wanna do that one."

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,281
"Let's do it."

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,659
It's a Tsuchinoko!

60
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,410
What?

61
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,789
-Damn it!
-That completes my collection!

62
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,875
I tried so many times
to get that Tsuchinoko!

63
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,877
And this kid gets it
on his first try?

64
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,256
I want it so bad!

65
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,426
That Tsuchinoko looks glorious!

66
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,011
I'll kill him.

67
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,682
Without so much as a pang of guilt,
I'll make that Tsuchinoko mine!

68
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,225
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,062
There's gotta be a smarter way
to get it from him.

70
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:35,651
For I am an advanced,
high-level schemer of a devil.

71
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:40,239
Wow, that's amazing.
You got the rare Tsuchinoko.

72
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,283
Can I get a closer look?

73
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,327
Sure, here you go.

74
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,087
Here you go.

75
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,089
What the hell was that for?

76
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,465
Damn snake!

77
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,301
You're disgusting!

78
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,890
You're the worst.

79
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,351
I don't even want it back, you idiot.

80
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,111
Thanks for the heartfelt compliment, little boy.

81
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,946
Success!

82
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,116
Got my Tsuchinoko! All right!

83
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,577
Time to shop and head home.

84
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,748
MEAT PAVILION YUKIO

85
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,711
That was a steal for such good meat.

86
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,007
I even got my Tsuchinoko,
I'm on a roll today.

87
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,761
You're the worst!

88
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,888
Now that I think about it...

89
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,561
was it really worth stealing?

90
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,521
Every time I see this,

91
00:05:54,688 --> 00:06:00,402
the memory of the boy beating me up
will replay in my head.

92
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,031
I'll store it so I don't see it when I get home.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,327
Hey, you!

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,579
Yeah, I'm talking to you, snake!

95
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,590
An unknown number. Hello?

96
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,760
-Is this Yurine Hanazono?
-Yes.

97
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,597
-This is Banzaibashi Police.
-Police?

98
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,141
-Hey!
-Yurine!

99
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,977
I got arrested by the police!

100
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,242
They really locked me up.

101
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,912
Don't you dare act

102
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,957
like you can get away with this!

103
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,507
The second uppercut of the day. Rough.

104
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,845
No chance for me to explain?
You'd be a bad parent!

105
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,888
I don't intend to be a parent.

106
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,727
Are you Yurine Hanazono, her guardian?

107
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,397
Sure, I guess.

108
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,859
Anyway, who are you?

109
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,110
Who am I?

110
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,364
I'm the Banzaibashi super cop
who keeps the peace in Akiba!

111
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,452
Mei Tachibana!

112
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,082
-Oh, right.
-Who do you think you are?

113
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,086
So tell me, what did Jashin-chan do?

114
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,588
She committed theft.

115
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,841
You gotta be kidding me.

116
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,219
You got it all wrong! Hear me out!

117
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,055
I don't even want it back, you idiot!

118
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,226
-What are you talking about?
-What do you mean?

119
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,980
She stole...

120
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,983
She stole...

121
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,906
My heart! My heart!

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,117
My heart! My heart!

123
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,121
I found her while on patrol

124
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,082
and she was so beautiful, I fell in love at first sight!

125
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,377
So, I stopped her and arrested her!

126
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,132
So cute! So beautiful!

127
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,634
Get away from me!

128
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,346
You're just abusing your power!

129
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,349
-You're just too cute!
-Stop!

130
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,352
-Let's get to the real issue here.
-Yes?

131
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,480
-May I have her?
-That's fine with me.

132
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,981
You didn't even hesitate!

133
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,151
Yes! Aren't you glad, Orochimaru?

134
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,989
She can't be serious about that name...

135
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,785
You're too cute, Orochimaru.

136
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,120
You're killing me.

137
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,499
She's sick! I don't wanna live with her!

138
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:06,088
Without Jashin-chan,
how am I gonna clean and cook?

139
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,258
-Sorry, I'll take her back.
-No!

140
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,135
Now that's just cruel,
you can't do that!

141
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,888
If I can't have Orochimaru...

142
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,642
You must die.

143
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,143
No way!

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,773
Whoops, I missed.

145
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,192
It scraped my tail!

146
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,779
Sorry I missed, Orochimaru.
At least my blades were sharp.

147
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,114
Does it hurt?

148
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,078
I love seeing you in pain, suffering.
So adorable!

149
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,418
Time for a celebratory selfie before I finish you.

150
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,214
Come on, give me a peace sign.

151
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,134
I can't... Please forgive me...

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,929
Too cute! So Insta-worthy.

153
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,976
-So good, I can't stop!
-I'm dying to go home...

154
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,272
Oh, it's 5. Work's over.

155
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,857
Gotta go home!

156
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,109
I refuse to work overtime.

157
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,071
That meat you bought at the market?

158
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,240
It's in the fridge at the station.

159
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,284
Don't forget to take it.

160
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
Later!

161
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,121
I'll see you again soon.

162
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,960
She thinks you're adorable. What a freak.

163
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,505
She was almost as crazy as you, Yurine.

164
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,842
You mentioned something
about a boy earlier.

165
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,094
-What was that about?
-What?

166
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,721
Oh, that was nothing.

167
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,935
I gotta bury that Tsuchinoko
as soon as I get home.

168
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,855
Jinbocho happenings!

169
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,040
I meant to go to the train station.

170
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,543
I wasn't paying attention,
so I entered the wrong door.

171
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,878
JINBOCHO STATION

172
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,881
Put your phone away
when you're walking.

173
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,514
Nice howl, Beth.

174
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:23,809
Let me join you.

175
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:44,204
My mother said the air
in the human world is polluted.

176
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,211
Feels good.

177
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,555
What?

178
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,808
-Please die.
-I decline.

179
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,936
I'm doomed!

180
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:12,274
If I can't just kill her, I thought I'd politely ask!

181
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,734
You really thought that was gonna work?

182
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,820
Damn it...

183
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,572
I'm gonna take a bath.

184
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,450
Make sure you take one after me.

185
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,076
Got it.

186
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,625
Did you think you were gonna
get lucky just now?

187
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,378
Just wait...

188
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,674
Check out the Tsuchinoko!

189
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,388
Hot damn.

190
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,392
I was on my knees, begging her to die.

191
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,480
Why can't she just die for me already?

192
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,857
She's so stubborn.

193
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,027
Well, I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy.

194
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,154
The mountains are so nice.

195
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,743
Why not take a break from the world
and free your body and soul in the mountains?

196
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,621
You call that taking a break?

197
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,541
What's the point in climbing
when you're gonna descend anyway?

198
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,337
Because the mountains are there?
I don't understand it one bit.

199
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,843
But wait, in those suspense dramas,
the murder always takes place...

200
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,386
on a mountain!

201
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,680
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

202
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,519
STOP! I'M SORRY I STOLE YOUR WIFE.

203
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,770
TOO LATE!

204
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,189
YOU WILL REPENT IN HELL!

205
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,984
I NEVER WANTED YOUR WIFE!
ALL I WANTED WAS YOU...!

206
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,156
I LOVED YOU TOO!

207
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:50,705
Which means mountains
are a prime location for murders.

208
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,376
If I can lure Yurine up into the mountains...

209
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,836
Killing her would be a piece of cake!

210
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,715
That'll be the end of Yurine!

211
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,511
Now, let's visualize this further.

212
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,809
Check out this view, Yurine.

213
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,730
Wow, what a stunning sight.

214
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,649
Hey, there!

215
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,695
Hey, there!

216
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,120
Finally!

217
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:35,000
I even get to finish her
with my signaturedropkick!

218
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,167
EVIL SMILE

219
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,837
How about this scenario?

220
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,048
This rope bridge sure sways a lot.

221
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,845
Help me, Jashin-chan.

222
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,018
Stop!

223
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,357
Yes! Yes!

224
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,695
But, wait, how about this scenario?

225
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,199
It's a bear.

226
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,493
We gotta play dead.

227
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,370
Now.

228
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,705
Let's do this.

229
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,500
Cross punch!

230
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,799
I could get a bear to collaborate with me.

231
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,720
That's an assured victory for me.

232
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,892
I'm so excited, I'm gonna wet myself.

233
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,186
That was a nice bath.

234
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,689
Hey, Yurine. Any plans for tomorrow?

235
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,982
Nope.

236
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,194
Then let's go hiking in the mountains.

237
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,237
No way.

238
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,242
Okay.

239
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:01,127
It seems like this anime
mostly take place in Yurine's room.

240
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,089
But it does make sense to be here.

241
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,759
Let's switch it up
and be in my room for a change.

242
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,389
-Thoughts?
-I barely feel the difference.

243
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,640
Okay.

244
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,518
Then let's give it a more drastic change.

245
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,398
-How about that?
-It's over-the-top!

246
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,952
Jashin-chan?

247
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,830
Got it. I'll be right there.

248
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,957
Okay.

249
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,503
Oh, yeah, I'll bring her a gift.

250
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,339
Thank you very much.

251
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,674
BEAN DAIFUKU

252
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,677
I hope she'll like it.

253
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,763
Oh yeah, can't forget to withdraw the money.

254
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,190
Hello!

255
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,696
Jashin-chan? I'm here.

256
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,700
I even got Fresh Moon for you.

257
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,497
Since it's the end of the month,
I stopped by the bank too.

258
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,460
Jashin-chan?

259
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,047
Jashin-chan, what's wrong?

260
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,729
What's... going on...?

261
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,689
Why...?

262
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,983
Jashin-chan...

263
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,236
She's dead...

264
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,327
She sounded so happy
when she called me earlier.

265
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,044
Jashin-chan!

266
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,674
Your reaction!

267
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,760
Your face!

268
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,179
I peeked through the closet...

269
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,057
It was priceless!
You should've seen it!

270
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,894
Ouch, I laughed so hard I fell over.

271
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,772
That's just the skin I shed.

272
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,026
Remember? I shed my skin
once every few thousand years.

273
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,196
And today was the day.

274
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,450
So, I thought of this prank and called you.

275
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,328
You really thought I died?

276
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,622
Of course not, right?

277
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,918
Hey, what's wrong?

278
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,424
Did you really think that was funny?

279
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,595
-What?
-You just crossed the line.

280
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:03,685
You have no idea how devastated I would be
if you were gone.

281
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,063
This isn't good...

282
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,193
Medusa's in passive-aggressive mode!

283
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,030
Let me explain.

284
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,826
Medusa gets passive-aggressive
when she's mad to the max!

285
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:25,081
Another phenomenon that happens
once every few thousand years...

286
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,334
Medusa's passive-aggressive mode.

287
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:33,089
Two rare events aligned with one another.

288
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,885
It's like celebrating Christmas
and New Year's at once.

289
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,430
Please excuse me now.

290
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,849
I won't be back for a while.

291
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,686
She's pissed.

292
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,606
I don't care about you anymore!

293
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm never coming back!

294
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,777
She's not all cutesy like usual.

295
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,699
Don't leave, Medusa!

296
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,328
You know I suffer from nervous gastritis!

297
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,747
If you leave me like this,

298
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,875
my tummy will get all messed up,

299
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,502
and I'll worry myself to death!

300
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,968
I admit, I crossed the line.

301
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,315
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,027
I didn't think you would get so upset.

303
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,862
I'm done. Bye.

304
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,491
Wait!

305
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,578
Forgive me, Medusa!
You're killing me!

306
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,048
Medusa...

307
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,175
Medusa...

308
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,929
My tummy...

309
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,309
Just kidding. That was payback.

310
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,813
I'll never leave you.

311
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,402
Medusa!

312
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,698
You crossed the line!

313
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,575
Go easy on those pranks, okay?

314
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,578
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry!

315
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,747
I'll never do it again.

316
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,416
There, there.

317
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,797
I'm home.

318
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,674
Welcome back!

319
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,385
Fresh Moon is so tasty!

320
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,596
This creamy texture goes so well with coffee.

321
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,850
It goes well with tea too.
Want some more?

322
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,023
-I'll unwrap it for you.
-Thanks!

323
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,859
Lovey-dovey as usual.

324
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,153
Say, "Ah."

325
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,865
-Yum!
-How is it?

326
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,366
Delicious!

327
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,785
You got some on your face.

328
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,370
Get it off for me.

329
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,895
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

330
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:38,816
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

331
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,155
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

332
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,576
As she starves to death!

333
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,204
It’s a love and hate relationship,

334
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,414
can’t leave each other alone

335
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:58,086
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

336
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:02,298
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

337
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,675
Test my heart, don’t stop

338
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:11,766
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

339
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:16,020
We’re a happy family La la la

340
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,274
Let me say, I love you!!

341
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,735
When all is said and done

342
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:27,448
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

343
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:32,120
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

344
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,372
For another crazy tomorrow

345
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,042
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

346
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,589
Insanity and screaming
gnaw at peoples' hearts.

347
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,135
As justice runs rampage,
the city is colored with demons' blood.

348
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,845
The angels are in despair.

349
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,267
Dropkick on My Devil!
We'll dive into your heart in the next episode too!

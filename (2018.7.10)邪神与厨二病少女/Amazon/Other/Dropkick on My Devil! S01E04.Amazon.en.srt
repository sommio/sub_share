1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:05,235
Won’t leave

2
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:11,032
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:17,205
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,136
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:34,722
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,557
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,311
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,188
If you go too far,

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:46,234
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,486
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:52,615
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:56,786
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:01,082
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,838
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:09,757
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,177
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:18,266
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:21,477
But until then,

20
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:27,442
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

21
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,368
Once a post-World War II
black market,

22
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:42,874
it has since evolved into an electronics
then computer district,

23
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:47,045
and now flourishes today
as the mecca of otaku.

24
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,464
This is Akihabara.

25
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,675
You'll find more than
400 Gachapon machines here.

26
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:53,676
GACHAPON HALL

27
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,387
You won't be able to resist
the urge to play!

28
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,683
If this comes out next, I'll die.

29
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:10,234
My life's spared. But a skyfish? Lame!

30
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:16,199
But, boy, I can't get enough
of that adrenaline rush putting my life on the line!

31
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,743
It's not like I'm really gonna die anyway.

32
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,832
I don't need any more of you.

33
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,876
What in the--?

34
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,672
You bastard! Can't you see
this devil lying in the street?

35
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:34,842
You might as well drive into a pole and die!

36
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:38,471
Hello, everyone, please do not
lie down in the street

37
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:41,474
and shout obscenities in public.

38
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,184
Damn it, another double!

39
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,061
Burn in Hell!

40
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:51,442
I just need that rare Tsuchinoko
and my collection's complete.

41
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,868
Nope. Not interested in the actual, physical one.

42
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:05,498
We can't have pets in Yurine's apartment.

43
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,042
Beth being an exception, of course.

44
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,711
Let's try this again.

45
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:15,675
I only have enough to buy dinner.

46
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,886
But, let's live it up...

47
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,806
Don't you dare waste that money.

48
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:24,308
If you do, I'll throw you in the wood chipper.

49
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,936
Throw you in the woodchipper...

50
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:28,438
Woodchipper...?

51
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:37,488
Woodchippers grind wood
into smaller woodchips.

52
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,241
One mistake using it, and you're on your way to hell!

53
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,535
Speak of the devil...

54
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:49,292
If I spend this money, I'm dead.
I give up.

55
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,043
Excuse me...

56
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,006
-I wanna do that one.
-Go ahead.

57
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,217
"I wanna do that one."

58
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,886
"Let's do it."

59
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,305
It's a Tsuchinoko!

60
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:04,015
What?

61
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:07,435
-Damn it!
-That completes my collection!

62
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,521
I tried so many times
to get that Tsuchinoko!

63
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,523
And this kid gets it
on his first try?

64
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,903
I want it so bad!

65
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:20,072
That Tsuchinoko looks glorious!

66
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,616
I'll kill him.

67
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:25,286
Without so much as a pang of guilt,
I'll make that Tsuchinoko mine!

68
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:26,871
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:30,666
There's gotta be a smarter way
to get it from him.

70
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:36,255
For I am an advanced,
high-level schemer of a devil.

71
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:40,885
Wow, that's amazing.
You got the rare Tsuchinoko.

72
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,888
Can I get a closer look?

73
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,973
Sure, here you go.

74
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:55,733
Here you go.

75
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,735
What the hell was that for?

76
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,111
Damn snake!

77
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,906
You're disgusting!

78
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,495
You're the worst.

79
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:09,956
I don't even want it back, you idiot.

80
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:19,715
Thanks for the heartfelt compliment, little boy.

81
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,592
Success!

82
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:24,762
Got my Tsuchinoko! All right!

83
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,223
Time to shop and head home.

84
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:31,394
MEAT PAVILION YUKIO

85
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:36,315
That was a steal for such good meat.

86
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:40,653
I even got my Tsuchinoko,
I'm on a roll today.

87
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,365
You're the worst!

88
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,534
Now that I think about it...

89
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:53,165
was it really worth stealing?

90
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,126
Every time I see this,

91
00:05:55,334 --> 00:06:01,007
the memory of the boy beating me up
will replay in my head.

92
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,635
I'll store it so I don't see it when I get home.

93
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,973
Hey, you!

94
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:11,225
Yeah, I'm talking to you, snake!

95
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:22,194
An unknown number. Hello?

96
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,406
-Is this Yurine Hanazono?
-Yes.

97
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:29,243
-This is Banzaibashi Police.
-Police?

98
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,746
-Hey!
-Yurine!

99
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:34,624
I got arrested by the police!

100
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,846
They really locked me up.

101
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,516
Don't you dare act

102
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,603
like you can get away with this!

103
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,153
The second uppercut of the day. Rough.

104
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:08,491
No chance for me to explain?
You'd be a bad parent!

105
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,534
I don't intend to be a parent.

106
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,374
Are you Yurine Hanazono, her guardian?

107
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,043
Sure, I guess.

108
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:22,505
Anyway, who are you?

109
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:23,756
Who am I?

110
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,968
I'm the Banzaibashi super cop
who keeps the peace in Akiba!

111
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,057
Mei Tachibana!

112
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,687
-Oh, right.
-Who do you think you are?

113
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:41,732
So tell me, what did Jashin-chan do?

114
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,234
She committed theft.

115
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,445
You gotta be kidding me.

116
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,865
You got it all wrong! Hear me out!

117
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,702
I don't even want it back, you idiot!

118
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,872
-What are you talking about?
-What do you mean?

119
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,626
She stole...

120
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,587
She stole...

121
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,552
My heart! My heart!

122
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:12,763
My heart! My heart!

123
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,726
I found her while on patrol

124
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,687
and she was so beautiful, I fell in love at first sight!

125
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:23,023
So, I stopped her and arrested her!

126
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,737
So cute! So beautiful!

127
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:29,238
Get away from me!

128
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,992
You're just abusing your power!

129
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:35,995
-You're just too cute!
-Stop!

130
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,956
-Let's get to the real issue here.
-Yes?

131
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,126
-May I have her?
-That's fine with me.

132
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:43,586
You didn't even hesitate!

133
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:46,756
Yes! Aren't you glad, Orochimaru?

134
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:51,635
She can't be serious about that name...

135
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,431
You're too cute, Orochimaru.

136
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,725
You're killing me.

137
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:01,145
She's sick! I don't wanna live with her!

138
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:06,734
Without Jashin-chan,
how am I gonna clean and cook?

139
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,904
-Sorry, I'll take her back.
-No!

140
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,782
Now that's just cruel,
you can't do that!

141
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,534
If I can't have Orochimaru...

142
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:19,246
You must die.

143
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,748
No way!

144
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,377
Whoops, I missed.

145
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,797
It scraped my tail!

146
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:31,425
Sorry I missed, Orochimaru.
At least my blades were sharp.

147
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,718
Does it hurt?

148
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,724
I love seeing you in pain, suffering.
So adorable!

149
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,064
Time for a celebratory selfie before I finish you.

150
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,819
Come on, give me a peace sign.

151
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,738
I can't... Please forgive me...

152
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,575
Too cute! So Insta-worthy.

153
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:01,622
-So good, I can't stop!
-I'm dying to go home...

154
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,876
Oh, it's 5. Work's over.

155
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,503
Gotta go home!

156
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,755
I refuse to work overtime.

157
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,676
That meat you bought at the market?

158
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:15,845
It's in the fridge at the station.

159
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,888
Don't forget to take it.

160
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,265
Later!

161
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,725
I'll see you again soon.

162
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:27,565
She thinks you're adorable. What a freak.

163
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:31,151
She was almost as crazy as you, Yurine.

164
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,446
You mentioned something
about a boy earlier.

165
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,699
-What was that about?
-What?

166
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,325
Oh, that was nothing.

167
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:44,582
I gotta bury that Tsuchinoko
as soon as I get home.

168
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,501
Jinbocho happenings!

169
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:05,686
I meant to go to the train station.

170
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:09,148
I wasn't paying attention,
so I entered the wrong door.

171
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,524
JINBOCHO STATION

172
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,485
Put your phone away
when you're walking.

173
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,118
Nice howl, Beth.

174
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:24,455
Let me join you.

175
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:44,808
My mother said the air
in the human world is polluted.

176
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,815
Feels good.

177
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,201
What?

178
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,454
-Please die.
-I decline.

179
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,582
I'm doomed!

180
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,878
If I can't just kill her, I thought I'd politely ask!

181
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:15,339
You really thought that was gonna work?

182
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,466
Damn it...

183
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,176
I'm gonna take a bath.

184
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:22,096
Make sure you take one after me.

185
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:23,722
Got it.

186
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,271
Did you think you were gonna
get lucky just now?

187
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,024
Just wait...

188
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,278
Check out the Tsuchinoko!

189
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,034
Hot damn.

190
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:47,997
I was on my knees, begging her to die.

191
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:52,126
Why can't she just die for me already?

192
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,503
She's so stubborn.

193
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,673
Well, I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy.

194
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,758
The mountains are so nice.

195
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:05,347
Why not take a break from the world
and free your body and soul in the mountains?

196
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:08,225
You call that taking a break?

197
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:12,146
What's the point in climbing
when you're gonna descend anyway?

198
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:15,983
Because the mountains are there?
I don't understand it one bit.

199
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:22,448
But wait, in those suspense dramas,
the murder always takes place...

200
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:24,033
on a mountain!

201
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,285
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

202
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:31,165
STOP! I'M SORRY I STOLE YOUR WIFE.

203
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:32,416
TOO LATE!

204
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:34,835
YOU WILL REPENT IN HELL!

205
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:38,589
I NEVER WANTED YOUR WIFE!
ALL I WANTED WAS YOU...!

206
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:43,802
I LOVED YOU TOO!

207
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:51,351
Which means mountains
are a prime location for murders.

208
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:55,022
If I can lure Yurine up into the mountains...

209
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:57,483
Killing her would be a piece of cake!

210
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:01,361
That'll be the end of Yurine!

211
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:05,115
Now, let's visualize this further.

212
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:11,455
Check out this view, Yurine.

213
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:16,335
Wow, what a stunning sight.

214
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,295
Hey, there!

215
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:22,341
Hey, there!

216
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,766
Finally!

217
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:35,646
I even get to finish her
with my signaturedropkick!

218
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:36,814
EVIL SMILE

219
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:39,483
How about this scenario?

220
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,694
This rope bridge sure sways a lot.

221
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:47,491
Help me, Jashin-chan.

222
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,664
Stop!

223
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:00,003
Yes! Yes!

224
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:04,341
But, wait, how about this scenario?

225
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,846
It's a bear.

226
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,098
We gotta play dead.

227
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:12,975
Now.

228
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,351
Let's do this.

229
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:18,105
Cross punch!

230
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:25,445
I could get a bear to collaborate with me.

231
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:29,366
That's an assured victory for me.

232
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,496
I'm so excited, I'm gonna wet myself.

233
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:36,832
That was a nice bath.

234
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:40,335
Hey, Yurine. Any plans for tomorrow?

235
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:41,587
Nope.

236
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:44,798
Then let's go hiking in the mountains.

237
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,884
No way.

238
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:51,847
Okay.

239
00:15:56,727 --> 00:16:01,773
It seems like this anime
mostly take place in Yurine's room.

240
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,735
But it does make sense to be here.

241
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:08,405
Let's switch it up
and be in my room for a change.

242
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:13,035
-Thoughts?
-I barely feel the difference.

243
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:14,286
Okay.

244
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:17,164
Then let's give it a more drastic change.

245
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:22,044
-How about that?
-It's over-the-top!

246
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,556
Jashin-chan?

247
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,476
Got it. I'll be right there.

248
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:39,603
Okay.

249
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:44,107
Oh, yeah, I'll bring her a gift.

250
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,985
Thank you very much.

251
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:48,278
BEAN DAIFUKU

252
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:51,323
I hope she'll like it.

253
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,368
Oh yeah, can't forget to withdraw the money.

254
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,795
Hello!

255
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:10,342
Jashin-chan? I'm here.

256
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,346
I even got Fresh Moon for you.

257
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:20,143
Since it's the end of the month,
I stopped by the bank too.

258
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,106
Jashin-chan?

259
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,694
Jashin-chan, what's wrong?

260
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:43,375
What's... going on...?

261
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,335
Why...?

262
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,587
Jashin-chan...

263
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,882
She's dead...

264
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:57,973
She sounded so happy
when she called me earlier.

265
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:06,648
Jashin-chan!

266
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,279
Your reaction!

267
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,406
Your face!

268
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,825
I peeked through the closet...

269
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:19,703
It was priceless!
You should've seen it!

270
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:23,498
Ouch, I laughed so hard I fell over.

271
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,376
That's just the skin I shed.

272
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:30,672
Remember? I shed my skin
once every few thousand years.

273
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:33,842
And today was the day.

274
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:38,055
So, I thought of this prank and called you.

275
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:40,974
You really thought I died?

276
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,226
Of course not, right?

277
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,564
Hey, what's wrong?

278
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:54,029
Did you really think that was funny?

279
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:58,241
-What?
-You just crossed the line.

280
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:04,331
You have no idea how devastated I would be
if you were gone.

281
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,667
This isn't good...

282
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:12,798
Medusa's in passive-aggressive mode!

283
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:16,635
Let me explain.

284
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:20,472
Medusa gets passive-aggressive
when she's mad to the max!

285
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:25,685
Another phenomenon that happens
once every few thousand years...

286
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,939
Medusa's passive-aggressive mode.

287
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:33,735
Two rare events aligned with one another.

288
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:37,531
It's like celebrating Christmas
and New Year's at once.

289
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,076
Please excuse me now.

290
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,495
I won't be back for a while.

291
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,332
She's pissed.

292
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,252
I don't care about you anymore!

293
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:52,796
I'm never coming back!

294
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,424
She's not all cutesy like usual.

295
00:19:57,134 --> 00:20:00,345
Don't leave, Medusa!

296
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:03,974
You know I suffer from nervous gastritis!

297
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,393
If you leave me like this,

298
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,521
my tummy will get all messed up,

299
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:12,107
and I'll worry myself to death!

300
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:19,614
I admit, I crossed the line.

301
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:32,961
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,673
I didn't think you would get so upset.

303
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:38,467
I'm done. Bye.

304
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,095
Wait!

305
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:46,224
Forgive me, Medusa!
You're killing me!

306
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,694
Medusa...

307
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,821
Medusa...

308
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:03,575
My tummy...

309
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,955
Just kidding. That was payback.

310
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,417
I'll never leave you.

311
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:18,006
Medusa!

312
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,344
You crossed the line!

313
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:25,222
Go easy on those pranks, okay?

314
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:28,225
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry!

315
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:30,393
I'll never do it again.

316
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,062
There, there.

317
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,443
I'm home.

318
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:40,278
Welcome back!

319
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,031
Fresh Moon is so tasty!

320
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:46,243
This creamy texture goes so well with coffee.

321
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,496
It goes well with tea too.
Want some more?

322
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,627
-I'll unwrap it for you.
-Thanks!

323
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:58,505
Lovey-dovey as usual.

324
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:00,757
Say, "Ah."

325
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:04,511
-Yum!
-How is it?

326
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:06,012
Delicious!

327
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,431
You got some on your face.

328
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:09,975
Get it off for me.

329
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,541
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

330
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,462
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

331
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:44,801
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

332
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:49,222
As she starves to death!

333
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:51,808
It’s a love and hate relationship,

334
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,019
can’t leave each other alone

335
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:58,732
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

336
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:02,944
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

337
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:05,322
Test my heart, don’t stop

338
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:12,412
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

339
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:16,625
We’re a happy family La la la

340
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,879
Let me say, I love you!!

341
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,381
When all is said and done

342
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:28,094
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

343
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:32,766
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

344
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,976
For another crazy tomorrow

345
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,647
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

346
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,194
Insanity and screaming
gnaw at peoples' hearts.

347
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:47,781
As justice runs rampage,
the city is colored with demons' blood.

348
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,491
The angels are in despair.

349
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:54,913
Dropkick on My Devil!
We'll dive into your heart in the next episode too!

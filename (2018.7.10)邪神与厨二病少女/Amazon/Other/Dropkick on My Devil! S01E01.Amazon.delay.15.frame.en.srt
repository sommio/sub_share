1
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:04,359
The principles of a devil summoning.

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,363
A devil summoned by sorcery

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,366
must be sent back by sorcery.

4
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:15,286
The human summoner becomes
the devil's master.

5
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:18,456
As long as the summoner lives,

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,626
the devil is bound
to the human world.

7
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,506
-Got a package for ya!
-Thank you.

8
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:29,342
-I-It was just a dream.
-Please sign here.

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,888
-A dream? No, more like...
-Thanks, have a great day!

10
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,266
-It's wrong to lie.
-You too.

11
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:41,229
Won’t leave

12
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:47,026
without a dropkick on her!

13
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:53,116
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

14
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:08,131
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

15
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,717
I gotta kill her or else
What?

16
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,635
I can’t go back to Hell!
Sister...

17
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:16,306
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

18
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,266
If you go too far,

19
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:22,228
I’ll slice you up completely!

20
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:24,522
Your halo!
Must get it back!

21
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,651
Never miss a chance
Hey, seriously?

22
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:32,864
To attack her from behind!
You’re so mean.

23
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:37,076
I’ll never give up.

24
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:38,745
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

25
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:42,915
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

26
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,835
Huh? What? I missed…

27
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,255
Can’t leave Earth

28
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:54,135
without a dropkick on her!

29
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:57,555
But until then,

30
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:03,436
let’s all have fun together!
Yeah!

31
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:10,026
Tokyo, the big city.

32
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,779
In the corner of this world,

33
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,075
another day of bittersweet drama

34
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,993
is about to unfold.

35
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:41,974
Let the hot pot party begin!

36
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:47,605
You're all in for a treat!
It's grade A beef!

37
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:50,483
It's not like you bought it.

38
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,027
D-Don't sweat the details.

39
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:54,654
Let's get started!

40
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:58,866
After heating up the pot,
we grease it with beef tallow.

41
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,246
Then, we'll grill the green onions!

42
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,415
Work up that appetite!

43
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:07,291
Smells delicious!

44
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,585
It smells wonderful!

45
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:14,132
We'll take them out once they brown
so we can grill the meat.

46
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:18,177
Please, God, forgive me.

47
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:22,348
Forgive me for attending
a witch's Sabbath when I'm an angel.

48
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:26,227
Yurine Hanazono, you kidnapped me
when I was starving.

49
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:27,895
What are you scheming?

50
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,481
No matter how hungry I am,

51
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,234
I can't face God after this!

52
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,196
Make sure both sides are cooked.

53
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,866
Meat, meat, I love meat!

54
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,535
Once it's fully cooked,
it's time for...

55
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:45,705
Jashin-chan's special stock!

56
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,957
We'll pour this right in!

57
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:54,422
U-Unbelievable.

58
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:57,675
Today's stock is especially divine!

59
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,511
I must be a genius!

60
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:02,722
Now we put in the veggies,

61
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,016
cook them until brown,
and it's done!

62
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,518
-I'm jealous, Yurine.
-Let me help you.

63
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:11,355
You have generous relatives who send
you quality meat.

64
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,275
It's not a regular thing.

65
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,526
That's right!

66
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:19,822
-We rarely have meat in hot pots.
-Huh?

67
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:21,991
It's usually full of veggies.

68
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:23,743
NO MEAT

69
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,495
Guess I was lucky today.

70
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:29,916
Why don't you get your relatives
to send us some meat in return?

71
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,337
Because that'll make us cannibals.

72
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,882
Ah, the hot pot's almost ready.

73
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:41,802
Looks delicious.

74
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,388
Here, Pekola, here's your egg.

75
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,058
-Thanks.
-Now dig in!

76
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,392
Let's eat!

77
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,561
I've no choice.

78
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:53,022
I'm starving.

79
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:55,733
-God will forgive me.
-Delicious!

80
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,361
It just melts in my mouth!

81
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,196
It's all right.

82
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:04,408
Pekola! What are you doing here?

83
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:07,161
This is a devil's dinner.

84
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,288
Coming from Heaven,

85
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:12,625
you're forbidden to eat with us,
aren't you?

86
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,336
Wait, Pekola's an angel?

87
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:18,256
-Seriously?
-But you invited me.

88
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,593
-Hey! Come by tonight for hot pot!
-Hot pot?

89
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:23,844
Jashin-chan...

90
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,513
You fool.

91
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,723
W-Who are you calling a fool?

92
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:31,894
She's the one who lost her halo
and can't go back to Heaven!

93
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,229
T-That's...

94
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:35,106
Enough already.

95
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:37,525
Shut up! Not another word!

96
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,735
-Jashin-chan...
-What?

97
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,655
-Let's just enjoy our meal.
-But!

98
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,992
Do not ruin this meal.

99
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,244
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:52,623
Just kidding! Forget everything.
Let's enjoy our meal.

101
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:54,458
W-What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,712
Here! Let me make your plate
for you!

103
00:05:57,878 --> 00:06:00,006
-We're best friends!
-Jashin-chan...

104
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:01,215
Such a handful.

105
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:02,758
Here ya go, fallen angel.

106
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:03,968
VEGGIES

107
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,304
Not one slice of meat...

108
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:09,849
Can't go wrong
with Wagyu beef, right?

109
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,351
May I get some meat too?

110
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:13,561
Rule number one.

111
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:18,149
Finish everything in your bowl
before you go for seconds.

112
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,775
My house, my rules.

113
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,902
Oh, it's out of this world!

114
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,113
So tender and juicy...

115
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:28,451
And I'm an angel,
not a fallen angel...

116
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,955
-Delicious!
-The veggies are good, but...

117
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:36,542
-Scrumptious!
-They're good, but...

118
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,128
The meat...

119
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,425
Cow...horse...

120
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,934
Finally...

121
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:56,646
Bok choy sure does fill you up.

122
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,898
-It's time--
-You finished, Pekola!

123
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:00,566
Let me get that for you!

124
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,777
Here ya go, fallen angel.

125
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,654
Bon appétit.

126
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:08,407
Jashin-chan, cut the bullying!

127
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,619
You're such a child.

128
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:13,287
See what I mean?

129
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:16,082
Here, Pekola, say, "Ah."

130
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,591
How is it?

131
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,093
Delicious.

132
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,928
I'm so glad.

133
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:30,971
A-An angel.

134
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:33,557
So who exactly is the angel here?

135
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,352
Here, Pekola, have some more meat.

136
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,813
Don't worry about the rules.

137
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:40,815
There.

138
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:44,026
Damn it!
You're all spoiling her rotten!

139
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:48,447
Medusa, Minos, you're both devils!
Why are you taking the angel's side?

140
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,074
Ignore her.

141
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,785
Y-Yurine...

142
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,913
If you're gonna play it like that...

143
00:07:56,997 --> 00:08:00,793
I'll just have to eat all the meat!

144
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:19,478
-The meat...
-Hey...

145
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:20,813
Don't do it...

146
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,859
All done!

147
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,318
J-J-Jashin-chan!

148
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:30,322
-The meat...
-How could you?

149
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:32,324
It used to be

150
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,535
a hot pot full of meat.

151
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:37,747
Our lovely meal...

152
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,415
Jashin-chan...

153
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,418
How will you pay for this?

154
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:46,046
You won't get away with this.

155
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:50,468
What? You wanna try me? Huh?

156
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,928
I-I'll go buy more meat!

157
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,974
There's not enough meat, you see?

158
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,602
I'll end you first!

159
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:03,606
I'm stuck here thanks to you.
All that resentment

160
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:08,235
caused by you summoning me
is gonna end you right now!

161
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,654
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

162
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,532
The first episode
is also the season finale!

163
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,243
Enjoy the rest as highlights!

164
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,625
Damn you, reptile.

165
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,881
Damn it! No! No! No!

166
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,301
How about some freshly sliced snake?

167
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,552
There's plenty.

168
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,846
I'll go buy more meat.

169
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,056
Too late now.

170
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:39,809
-Wonder if it's any good?
-Yurine Hanazono.

171
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,685
Never mess with her.

172
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:48,192
Snake meat!
It's actually pretty good!

173
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,369
-What's the password?
-Huh?

174
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:02,122
-Um...
-Rhymes with Hannibal...

175
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:03,833
Cannibal.

176
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,876
You may enter!

177
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:10,506
Don't scare me!
Jashin-chan, you're too paranoid.

178
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:13,592
Never underestimate the human world.

179
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:20,015
Jashin-chan,
I've been thinking these days...

180
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,101
What about?

181
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,229
-This....
-No way!

182
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,273
You really got it for me!

183
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:29,525
Huh?

184
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:31,986
Jashin-chan.

185
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:34,655
-You're up to no good, right?
-Yup.

186
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,617
Idiot.
What the hell do you think this is?

187
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,703
You can't have it!

188
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:43,122
-I saw the news.
-The criminal escaped.

189
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:46,208
According to police investigation,

190
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,835
the weapon used...

191
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,503
The weapon...

192
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,338
Surprise, surprise!

193
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:56,135
This weapon often gets
featured in crime reports.

194
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,513
A crowbar!

195
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:01,849
I figured it out.

196
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,893
As I slept and ate all day,

197
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:07,688
woke up and watched TV all day,

198
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,982
I noticed how the crowbar

199
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,735
would get featured on TV
almost daily!

200
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:18,073
That's right! It's because
it's the best weapon to use to kill a human!

201
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,492
Yurine's dead meat!

202
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,994
Stop Jashin-chan!

203
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:24,788
You'll end up killing Yurine!

204
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:28,125
-Uh, that's the point.
-What?

205
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,171
I'm gonna kill her with one strike!

206
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,299
Ouch! Stop! Forgive me, please!

207
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:37,635
No way! I'll never forgive you!

208
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:38,928
ONE STRIKE...?

209
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:43,015
Her brains will splatter
all over the place!

210
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,394
This is too good.

211
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:50,105
Plus, the crowbar was purchased
by Medusa.

212
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:54,568
I'll be innocent,
and didn't pay a penny for it.

213
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,571
It's the perfect crime!

214
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,366
You're like the devil, Jashin-chan!

215
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,952
Last I checked, I am the devil!

216
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,288
Dear God, please give her
divine punishment.

217
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:09,625
Nice try, but you're a devil too!

218
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:12,795
I'm back.

219
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,296
Welcome home!

220
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:15,923
W-Welcome back.

221
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:18,968
Oh, hey, Medusa. How are you?

222
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,427
Doing well, thanks.

223
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,638
That movie you wanted to watch?

224
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,641
Medusa bought it for us!

225
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,395
You must be tired.
Why don't you go wind down?

226
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,939
Really? Thanks so much, Medusa.

227
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:33,816
N-No problem.

228
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,026
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

229
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:41,949
Could I go watch it?

230
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,827
Of course! Please do.

231
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,286
Don't mind us.

232
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,713
Holy shit!

233
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,345
Get into it, Yurine.

234
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:06,682
Because when you're completely
focused on the movie,

235
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,976
I'm gonna bust your brains out!

236
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,187
This is the end.

237
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:17,901
Good bye, Yurine.
Viewers, it's your lucky day.

238
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:22,614
You all get to witness human brains

239
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,325
splatter all over the place!

240
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,202
-Gotcha.
-What?

241
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:29,663
Bam.

242
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:33,625
-How did she know?
-You said it all out loud.

243
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,085
Long lines, too.

244
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,797
Sound engineer!
It's called internal monologue!

245
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,966
Let's redo this! Cut! Cut!

246
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,885
Who are you talking to?

247
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,178
It was all Medusa!

248
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,556
I resisted
but she threatened me to do it!

249
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:50,059
Liar! You're unbelievable.

250
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,311
Medusa, you're the liar here!

251
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:55,189
-You're setting me up!
-I can't watch this.

252
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:58,484
Jashin-chan.

253
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:02,196
Need I say more?

254
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,865
D-Damn it.

255
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:09,203
Now I gotta resort to this.
The ultimate soul-crusher!

256
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,456
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

257
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,718
J-J-J-Jashin-chan?

258
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,476
I can't get up.

259
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:35,771
My spine's totally crushed.

260
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,694
What the hell is that?

261
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,197
You failed miserably.

262
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:49,993
So I'm gonna take this opportunity
to treat our viewers

263
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:55,207
to the slaughter of a devil,
where your insides get exposed

264
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:58,085
-as you get minced.
-No! Yurine, stop!

265
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,296
No! No!

266
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:05,008
No!

267
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:10,264
-You're just gonna turn a blind eye?
-Yup.

268
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:16,395
That day, this room was scarlet red.

269
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,022
Was it red from

270
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,775
the sun setting in the skyline?

271
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,361
Or the minced meat of Jashin-chan?

272
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,738
I don't know!

273
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:30,826
Jeez, I know I can regenerate myself
but don't just stand there.

274
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:33,495
Now.

275
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:37,833
Will Jashin-chan fully recover
during the commercial break?

276
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,335
I have no idea!

277
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,964
The murder weapon used
was the chainsaw itself.

278
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,306
You're still censored.

279
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,642
Don't worry, it'll come off soon.

280
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:00,856
The room's gonna be spotless too.

281
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:02,566
You can count on me!

282
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:03,942
Okay.

283
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:08,614
I'm gonna splurge tonight for dinner
so come back soon!

284
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,574
See ya later!

285
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,075
Bye.

286
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,958
The censoring was all fake.

287
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,501
Slurp.

288
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:25,589
Yurine has no idea
that I'm fully recovered.

289
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:26,965
TOMATO JUICE

290
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,092
Today's her birthday.

291
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:32,512
I'm gonna invite everyone
for a wild celebration.

292
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,224
For a surprise party to celebrate
Yurine's death!

293
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,311
Plus, my horoscope says
I've got the best luck today!

294
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,479
SCORPIO

295
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:44,233
I got Medusa to pick up the cake
and my lucky item for the day.

296
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,442
LUCKY ITEM: STUN GUN

297
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,236
I'm gonna be geared up!

298
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:51,073
Ah, yeah!
It's gonna be a piece of cake!

299
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:52,491
Break.

300
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:57,037
As you requested.

301
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,706
Thanks a lot!

302
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,834
You're always so generous
with your money.

303
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:06,838
Don't do it, Jashin-chan.
Don't commit any more crimes!

304
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:10,634
Jashin-chan,
planning on killing Yurine again?

305
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,345
You're gonna end up
paying for it anyway.

306
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:18,225
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm all geared up today.

307
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:19,977
-See?
-Huh?

308
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,478
And for the record,

309
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,774
I haven't committed
any kind of crime so far.

310
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,485
Since it's been
a consistent failure.

311
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:32,614
Anyway, let me give you the rundown
of how this is gonna go down.

312
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,494
-I'm back.
-First, clueless Yurine comes home.

313
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:41,164
-Happy Birthday!
-We distract her with a surprise.

314
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,501
Forgive me, God,
I know I'm an angel, and yet--

315
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,962
Hey! I'm not done here!

316
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:49,548
We'll distract her.

317
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,384
Then, I come running up
with a present--

318
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:56,471
Not! It's the stun gun
Medusa picked up for me. Ta-da!

319
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:58,265
I electrocute her.

320
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,434
And she's paralyzed.

321
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,603
Then, I'll finish her
using the kitchen knife...

322
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,564
By stabbing her in the gut!

323
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,482
The perfect plan.

324
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,319
-What a joke.
-You'll fail again.

325
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,113
No, I won't! My horoscope said so!

326
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,991
-I'm geared up with my lucky item!
-I see.

327
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,828
Yurine... But why...?

328
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,706
You told me to come back soon.

329
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,333
Whoopsie.

330
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,543
Not much of a surprise now, huh?

331
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,005
I'm so sorry.
I haven't even started cooking yet.

332
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:33,508
-Medusa threatened me to do this!
-What?

333
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,885
Such a manipulator.

334
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,095
Just give up and apologize.

335
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,348
It's a bit too late for that.

336
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,475
Take this, Yurine!

337
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,728
This is your birthday present
from me!

338
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,355
Die!

339
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,734
What?

340
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,991
What the hell?
An electric shaver for beards?

341
00:18:58,241 --> 00:18:59,993
What are you trying to tell me?

342
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,746
Medusa! You traitor!

343
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,664
I just wanted you to stop...

344
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,541
Cut the crap!

345
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,878
You better do the same, or else...

346
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,715
U-Um... Is that...a stun gun?

347
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,093
You're a bit slow to notice.

348
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,428
But my birthday's October 31st.

349
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,806
I'm a Scorpio, just like you.

350
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,142
SCORPIO
OCTOBER 23RD-NOVEMBER 21ST

351
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,895
All right!
Time to finish decorating!

352
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:29,356
-Yup.
-I'll prepare dinner.

353
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,025
Jashin-chan... Come on.

354
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,403
Need I say more?

355
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:36,905
No.

356
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:40,951
Yurine!

357
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,286
Happy Birthday!

358
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:44,955
Thank you all.

359
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,998
Here's your egg, Yurine.

360
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,627
-Thanks.
-Let me serve the meat for you.

361
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:01,304
Delicious. I love the seasoning.

362
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:05,892
Actually, that's all Jashin-chan.

363
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:07,978
Really?

364
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:18,113
Hey, is she gonna be okay?

365
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:23,034
Oh, she'll be fine.
She can regenerate.

366
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:27,372
-But...
-Don't worry, she'll regenerate.

367
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,294
Hey, Medusa. Help me.

368
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:33,753
No way!

369
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,798
-Help me.
-No way!

370
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,886
-Minos...
-Never!

371
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,095
Jashin-chan.

372
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,474
Do you repent?

373
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,061
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

374
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:53,064
Positive?

375
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:54,733
Yes!

376
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,028
Fine, then.

377
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,448
I'll forgive you.

378
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:09,164
Dig in, Jashin-chan.

379
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:12,626
I still can't move.

380
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,045
I'll feed you.

381
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:19,508
Medusa prepared
such a great meal for us.

382
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,426
Eat the beef tallow.

383
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:29,643
So this is what they call,
"the Sabbath."

384
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,191
Are we all ready?

385
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:46,326
Come on. Give us a smile.

386
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,622
I've had enough today.

387
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:55,418
I had a pretty good time.

388
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,712
You better say that.

389
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,756
I've sacrificed myself--

390
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,591
Now, smile at the camera.

391
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:04,177
-Ready?
-If Yurine's a Scorpio like me...

392
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:05,804
Happy Birthday!

393
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:10,225
What about my birthday party?

394
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:34,791
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

395
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,546
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

396
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:43,883
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

397
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:48,597
As she starves to death!

398
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,725
It’s a love and hate relationship,

399
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,144
can’t leave each other alone

400
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:58,815
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

401
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:02,986
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

402
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,405
Test my heart, don’t stop

403
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:12,495
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

404
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:16,708
We’re a happy family La la la

405
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:21,004
Let me say, I love you!!

406
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,465
When all is said and done

407
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:28,136
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

408
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:32,766
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

409
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:34,976
For another crazy tomorrow

410
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:38,772
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

411
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:43,527
When the summer heat is making you melt,

412
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:45,404
you hear a knock at the door.

413
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:50,117
There is a brutal snow woman who came from hell
that makes even our blood cold.

414
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,955
Dropkick on My Devil!
Be prepared to be clotheslined by the next episode too!

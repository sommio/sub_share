1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,630
Won’t leave

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,386
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,559
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,584
If you go too far,

9
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,588
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,969
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,182
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,436
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,062
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,661
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,873
But until then,

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

21
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,010
Dinner's ready!

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,389
I'm serving curry tonight.

23
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,062
Nice, pork cutlet curry.

24
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,065
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

25
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,443
-All done.
-All done.

26
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,620
Curry for dinner, huh?
Looks good!

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,458
THE NIGHT AFTER

28
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,711
Curry for dinner again!

29
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,339
It's hamburger steak curry tonight.

30
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,717
Curry's best on the second day.

31
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,512
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

32
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,139
-All done.
-All done!

33
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,977
THE NIGHT AFTER.
AGAIN.

34
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,188
That's right! It's curry three nights in a row!

35
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,232
That's a bit excessive...

36
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,152
We shouldn't be doing this,
even for just 20 minutes.

37
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,071
Not to worry.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,906
This is the last time.

39
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,577
Still, it's three days in a row...

40
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,204
Rock, paper...

41
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,873
-Scissors.
-Scissors.

42
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,624
I didn't mean to win.

43
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,503
Jashin-chan, you just won

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,631
the privilege of getting out the mayo.

45
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,383
Yes! Right away!

46
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,137
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

47
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,013
YURINE

48
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,396
Is-- Is that for your curry?

49
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,023
Of course.

50
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,026
Mayo on curry?

51
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,028
That's sacrilege!

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,322
They really go well together.

53
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,784
Here, try it.

54
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,880
-It's delicious!
-See?

55
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,799
But why? How is that possible?

56
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,509
Can't go wrong with mayo.

57
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,597
That didn't answer my question.
Nevertheless, it's good.

58
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,140
No doubt about it.

59
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,061
Curry and mayo,
the winning combo.

60
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,771
No doubt!

61
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,105
That's it!

62
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,276
-I'm making curry again tomorrow!
-Again?

63
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,285
Look at that.

64
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,455
So, you can buy
these things on Amazon.

65
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,875
You're really making curry again?

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,170
Yup. It's chicken curry tonight.

67
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,799
If you power walk

68
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:22,012
I live five minutes away
From the station.

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,390
The katar or chakram...

70
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,767
Which do you think is sharper?

71
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,022
Hey.

72
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,191
Are you listening to me?

73
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,734
What?

74
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,487
She disappeared.

75
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,117
What's going on?

76
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,244
What just happened?

77
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,787
Let me explain!

78
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,832
While Jashin-chan
was stirring the curry,

79
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,961
she unintentionally formed
a magic circle

80
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,255
and sacrificed the chicken!

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,052
Furthermore, her random song matched up with the spell
that opened the gates to the other dimension.

82
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,555
Five minutes away
From the station

83
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,642
Jashin-chan was sucked into a warp!

84
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,771
Where am I?

85
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,357
Looks familiar, but...

86
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,612
The entrance to Hell!

87
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,322
Welcome to Hell
Free parking available in 666 miles

88
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,702
How did stirring the curry
get me here?

89
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,829
Maybe...!

90
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,123
The kitchen exploded...

91
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
BANG

92
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,461
And killed Yurine?

93
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,088
Oh, no!

94
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,927
No, if that's the case,
I'd be dead too.

95
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,097
I don't get what happened.

96
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,349
But if all the conditions aren't met,

97
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,394
I'm just gonna get turned away.

98
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:57,066
Hey, she looks like Jashin-chan,
all grown up.

99
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:02,237
Only the fact that she's half-viper.
Otherwise, not at all.

100
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,616
She's identical to you!
She must be a relative.

101
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,793
Tiny Medusa, Minos...

102
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,628
And me!

103
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,256
Seems like she knows us.

104
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,133
See? She's a relative.

105
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,469
Are you my relative?

106
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,513
Where are you from?

107
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,935
I was cooking in the human world just a minute ago.
Before I knew it, I was here.

108
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,394
The human world?

109
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:39,274
Isn't the human world completely vacant
because of the great flood?

110
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:44,738
The great flood...?
The one from 7000 years ago?

111
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,074
Noah!

112
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,745
Does that mean
I went back in time?

113
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,752
So, you're saying that you're Jashin-chan
from the future?

114
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,296
I'm sure you don't believe it.

115
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,298
I believe you.

116
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,010
Your eyes don't lie.

117
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,555
Medusa, as adorable as you are,

118
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,391
don't let some fool deceive you.

119
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,310
-Hey, miss!
-Yeah?

120
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,521
What am I like in the future?

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,193
That flat chest of yours

122
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,946
is about triple the size!

123
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,325
Triple the size?
That sounds powerful!

124
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,702
You are strong.

125
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,620
But, not as strong as me.

126
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,330
What about me?

127
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,210
-You're always working.
-Really?

128
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,214
One of the most wonderful inventions
of the future is the ATM...

129
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,092
Me! What about me?

130
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,511
-This.
-What?

131
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,805
You're looking straight at it.

132
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,975
No way!

133
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,979
I was planning on becoming
a lot cooler!

134
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,232
In your dreams!

135
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:08,614
This is bad. I have no idea
how to get back to the human world.

136
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,117
Leave that to us!

137
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,787
We'll send you back
with our secret ritual.

138
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,584
Curry's up!

139
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:26,048
DROPKICK ON MY DEVIL!

140
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,260
Now that's some fiery curry.

141
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,649
I remember this.

142
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,401
But it's not gonna work.

143
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,196
We tried so many times.

144
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,408
We always failed.

145
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,995
Look, she disappeared.

146
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,414
Did it work?

147
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,460
Did you wish really hard
for her return?

148
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,838
-Nope! I was dreaming about dinner!
-What?

149
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,424
I'm starving!
I wonder what's for dinner tonight.

150
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,093
I hope it's curry.

151
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,386
Curry? That sounds good.

152
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,638
-I love chicken curry.
-Is she okay?

153
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,932
Beef curry's my favorite,
hands down.

154
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,185
-Hey, that makes you a cannibal.
-Shut up.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,854
DEVILISHLY DELICIOUS NAAN

156
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,439
Ouch.

157
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,441
What?

158
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,402
Finally, I'm back.

159
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,862
Where in the world have you been?

160
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,574
One minute, you're gone.

161
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,369
Next thing you know,
you're on the table

162
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,080
destroying all the food.

163
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:45,335
Did you know that curry stains
are impossible to get out?

164
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,632
Amazon delivery!

165
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,430
I just ordered a minute ago.

166
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,766
And it's already here.

167
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,728
Thank goodness for Prime.

168
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,650
They're both really sharp.

169
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,486
I'm shocked you kept
on eating dinner

170
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,615
when I suddenly vanished
in front of your eyes!

171
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,576
Curry again?

172
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,578
Looks good!

173
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,914
Patience is key
when it comes to love and curry!

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
August is almost over.

175
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,634
But it's still really hot.

176
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,432
Don't ignore me. Say something.

177
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,189
That shaved ice from the stand
was awesome!

178
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,567
Yeah! The lemon flavor was crazy good.

179
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,070
I wanna eat shaved ice!

180
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,865
Was there a shaved ice stand
around here?

181
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,867
Could that be it?

182
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,328
SHAVED ICE

183
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,664
Come and enjoy some shaved ice!

184
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,376
Hey, it's Yusa and Koji!

185
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,504
Hey, you two. How are you?

186
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,048
It was you guys.

187
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,717
It's the off-season in Hell right now.

188
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,844
So we came out here to work.

189
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,847
-It's pretty good money.
-What?

190
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,016
You get rich off shaved ice?

191
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,851
Jashin-chan...

192
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,939
They're only able to make profit
because there's no overhead

193
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,358
in producing the ice and syrups.

194
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,235
It won't be the same for you.

195
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,572
Too late.

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:44,204
Brain freeze! That's cold!

197
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,041
I'm gonna make a killing
off shaved ice too!

198
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,379
If Yusa's selling theirs
for 200 yen...

199
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,966
I'll sell it for 300!

200
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,886
Dummy. They'll all go for the cheaper one.

201
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,264
I'd like a melon one please!

202
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,850
-Sold!
-No way.

203
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,979
Here they come!

204
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,732
This heat must be getting to everyone.

205
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,531
This shaved ice machine
is really inefficient.

206
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,245
They're able to produce ice
in a split second.

207
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,293
Damn it! Those brats!

208
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll operate three machines,
with hands and my tail!

209
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,800
Hilarious

210
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,431
Head pain caused by eating
shaved ice is also called

211
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,391
an "ice cream" headache.

212
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,144
That's an official medical term.

213
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:54,065
I scream after that first bite
of shaved ice!

214
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,569
JASHIN SHAVED ICE

215
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,948
It's completely dead now.

216
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,619
They still have a huge line.

217
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,833
Damn you, Koji!
I'll change your name to Mimori

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,753
so it's harder for you
to establish character.

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,964
That's a pretty obscure reference.

220
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,510
Wow, it's so light!

221
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,845
This is heavenly!

222
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,598
How ironic, they're devils.

223
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,103
The cheap ice, flavored syrups,

224
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,481
and toy-like shaved ice machine

225
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,360
can't compete with their
light and powdery ice.

226
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,030
I must obtain the best ingredient to win!

227
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,119
I'm going on a quest for natural ice
from Mount Fuji!

228
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,384
The air is so thin.

229
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,303
But I made it to the sacred place.

230
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,641
I hope...

231
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,269
I find Jashin-chan soon.

232
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,898
Ice, ice, ice!

233
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,277
I'm fully stocked.

234
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,988
Where did all that energy come from?

235
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,408
To achieve the finest ice...

236
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,079
I got a professional shaved ice
machine and expensive syrups!

237
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,874
-Voila!
-Where did you get the money?

238
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,754
Medusa, I bought all of this
with your money

239
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,673
so I could win.

240
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,301
-Good luck.
-She died?

241
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,637
In order to bring Yusa
and Koji down,

242
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,306
I'm selling mine

243
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,349
for only five yen!

244
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,643
You can kiss profit goodbye.

245
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,941
I'll produce better-quality ice to beat them!

246
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,445
-That wasn't her initial objective.
-Fluffy, fluffy ice!

247
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,575
Yusa and Koji, you guys

248
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,452
are about to be annihilated!

249
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,996
Now, humans...

250
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:17,250
Come and buy
the ultimate shaved ice!

251
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,086
Not so fast, viper girl.

252
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,966
You don't have a permit
to do business here.

253
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,718
A permit?

254
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,930
We have our permit, of course.

255
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,098
PERMIT

256
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,393
You can't do business here.

257
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,439
You'd better come with us.

258
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,567
I see you're half-viper...

259
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,154
-but your upper half could make you rich.
-What?

260
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,990
Well, actually,
I've got a viper fetish.

261
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,536
I think she wants you to save her.

262
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,666
No, that's the "Don't worry, I've got this" look.

263
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,627
Come on over! It's hot and fresh!

264
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:01,836
One please!

265
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,004
CURRY SHAVED ICE

266
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,096
All right. That should do it.

267
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,893
Wow, this is heavy.

268
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,523
I've got no stamina
since I haven't been eating.

269
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,071
Where did this random huge rock come from?

270
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,826
If only I had my halo, I could turn that into bread.

271
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,834
That's enough water
for today and tomorrow.

272
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,088
How did that get ripped?

273
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,428
Pekola, I found you.

274
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,432
You're the angel apprentice.

275
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,850
That's me, Poporon.

276
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,145
But I'm a full-fledged angel now,
thank you very much.

277
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,777
The angel radar app didn't sense you.
So that was quite a feat.

278
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,989
As you can see, I lost my halo.

279
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,950
So there was no way
for me to contact Heaven.

280
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,077
That's why the radar didn't work.

281
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,915
I've been dreaming of this day.

282
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,878
I can finally go back to Heaven now!

283
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,048
When I go back, I'm gonna relax in a hot bath.

284
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,763
Nourish myself with nectar and a feast.

285
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,725
Then I'll fall into a deep sleep in a warm bed.

286
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,061
What are you waiting for?
Take me back to Heaven!

287
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,065
Good-bye, Pekola.

288
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,201
Stop, don't move.

289
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,703
What's going on?

290
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,164
Here's another one!

291
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,708
Ready? Yakisoba!

292
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,178
But why?

293
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:22,185
I'm currently serving as your substitute,
since you're missing.

294
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,566
But if you return,
I go back to being an apprentice again.

295
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,655
That'll put an end to my glory days
of bossing other angels around.

296
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,699
I don't follow at all.

297
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,702
You're as thick as a brick!

298
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:45,667
As long as you stay out of Heaven,
I'll be treated like royalty!

299
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,672
So you're not here to bring me back...

300
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,592
I'm here to get rid of you for good.

301
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,179
Just when I thought...

302
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,057
I was about to go home.

303
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,351
How could this be...?

304
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,607
I'm so lucky to find you
stripped of angel powers.

305
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,442
Now you're just a piece of meat.

306
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,361
-Meat...
-No, more like waste.

307
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,572
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

308
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,660
I always had a feeling
she wasn't an angel at heart.

309
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,787
But this is just ridiculous.

310
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not an angel because I'm worthy of it...

311
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,129
I'm an angel because
I was born to become one.

312
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,175
Hey, what's up?

313
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,137
Is this a bad time?

314
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,930
A devil?

315
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,893
Yurine sent me to deliver this curry to you .

316
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,394
Curry!

317
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,690
But I can't accept charity from a witch.

318
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,444
-What? You can't eat my curry?
-Hey!

319
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,363
-It's out of this world good.
-Hey!

320
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,240
You're in the way!

321
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,535
I'll finish you later.
Get out of the way!

322
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,877
You call that curry?
It's all potatoes.

323
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,629
Now get out of my sight.

324
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,380
Tastes good!

325
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,758
Curry's best the second day.

326
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,761
Day three of simmering in the pot.

327
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,893
Garam masala!

328
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,981
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

329
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:33,942
Die!

330
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,863
How could you do that to my curry?

331
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,574
Waste human lives all you want!

332
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,370
But don't you ever waste precious food!

333
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,206
-Give me the packing tape!
-Okay.

334
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,125
Take that!

335
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:01,260
Kazuyo, this is revenge
for breaking up with me.

336
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,303
WILL

337
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,848
Dear God, please forgive me
for wasting this life.

338
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:21,114
I don't wanna die!
Save me, Mommy!

339
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,788
No sight of Poporon...

340
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,541
Who was that anyway?

341
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,502
-Oh, well--
-Never mind, I don't care.

342
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,921
I'm famished from running so hard.

343
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,715
Let's go.

344
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,511
Yurine won't believe my story,
that a weirdo spilled my curry.

345
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:48,016
Rather than having her send me back out,
let's just eat together.

346
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,768
But it's a devil's...

347
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,230
Stop making such a fuss. Let's go.

348
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,775
You can't let my curry go to waste.

349
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,241
I hate to admit it,
but I was saved by this devil today.

350
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,853
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

351
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,775
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

352
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:44,113
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

353
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:48,534
As she starves to death!

354
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,162
It’s a love and hate relationship,

355
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,372
can’t leave each other alone

356
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:58,044
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

357
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:02,256

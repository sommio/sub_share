1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,630
Won't leave

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,386
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,475
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,542
If you go too far

9
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,546
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,923
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,969
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,265
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:00,394
I'll never give up

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,146
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,661
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,873
But until then

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:44,939
JULY 9TH
17:00

22
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,697
LIFE THEATER

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,999
The Goddess of Victory
smiles upon me.

24
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,214
JULY 9TH
17:24

25
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,013
Lost big time, yet again.

26
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,892
I should've resisted the urge!

27
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,354
What the hell was I thinking?

28
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,108
How could I go completely broke
in just 30 minutes?

29
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,069
This alley is dangerous.

30
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:36,240
I only took this shortcut
so I wouldn't miss the sale!

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,412
But my right hand insisted
that I play the slots.

32
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,915
Stop it! That's enough!

33
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,668
Life is so cruel!

34
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,881
Dear God, take me back in time,
before I stepped inside to play.

35
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,549
Please!

36
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,175
JASHIN-CHAN LIFE THEATER
FIN

37
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,510
Jashin-chan!

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,012
There you are, my ATM.

39
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,181
I was just on my way to see you.

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,684
I brought you Fresh Moon,
your favorite.

41
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,228
Fresh Moon?

42
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,938
Fresh...?

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,481
New...?

44
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,567
Moon? A new moon?

45
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,485
A fresh start.

46
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,779
This is my moment.

47
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,698
When shall I seize it?

48
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,949
Now's the time!

49
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:20,951
Are you okay?

50
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,455
I beg you.

51
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,041
Lend me 20,000 yen!

52
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,376
I'll double it for you!

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,170
Sucker!

54
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,090
You idiot!

55
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,593
You really pushed your luck today.

56
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,012
And came out a broke loser.

57
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,391
You even had the gall
to spend our dinner budget.

58
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,727
I have no choice
but to kill you.

59
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,104
Medusa, help me!

60
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,648
Please forgive her!

61
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,650
She's sorry!

62
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,735
She's a good girl by nature.

63
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,487
Right, Jashin-chan?

64
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,866
See? Look at that pure smile.

65
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,495
My face...

66
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,373
She's corrupt by nature.

67
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,291
Are you all right?

68
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,876
Not at all.

69
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,837
I give you an allowance.

70
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,549
-Limit yourself to that money.
-Okay.

71
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,261
Make sure you pay Medusa back
her 20,000 yen too.

72
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,973
TOO BROKE TO PAY BACK

73
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,141
No excuses.

74
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,309
Roger that!

75
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,895
Don't worry, pay me back
when you can.

76
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,064
Quit spoiling her, Medusa.

77
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,695
The money you blew?
It's coming out of your allowance.

78
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,990
Redeem yourself.
Go get the groceries this time.

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,533
You got it!

80
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,536
I won't disappoint you this time!

81
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,497
I promise never to give in
to my demons again!

82
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,208
Jashin-chan...

83
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,876
Should I go with you?

84
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,672
No need.

85
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,466
I reap what I sow.

86
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,760
Then I will earn her trust back!

87
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,637
That's the spirit!

88
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,016
Catch you later!

89
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,440
Jashin-chan...
Where could she be?

90
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,069
What is this?

91
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,284
What a shame.

92
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:29,830
Japan's supposed to be the country
with the 13th-best air quality in the world.

93
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,258
What's taking her so long?

94
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,718
Think she...?

95
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,680
Let's believe in her.
I know she's a good girl.

96
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,476
Don't strike out on life
with gambling and blow!

97
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,730
Jashin-chan dropkick!

98
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,231
In the park!

99
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,361
Thanks for the bread crusts!

100
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,529
Later!

101
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,031
I know you get fed!

102
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,325
So why steal from me?

103
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,703
That was three days' worth of food...

104
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,998
Oh, Pekola, what a sorry sight.

105
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,417
Poporon.

106
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:20,172
I was ready to crack open
that devil's head

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,882
but she ran off.

108
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,675
But, wait a minute...

109
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,302
Just the other day,

110
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,263
the devil came by
to drop off curry for Pekola.

111
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,640
Could it be...

112
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,143
Did you befriend a devil
even though you're an angel?

113
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,444
Seriously?

114
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,488
Pekola...

115
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,118
It's not like that.

116
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,163
We're not friends or anything.

117
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,334
What happened to your halo?

118
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,128
That devil ate mine.

119
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,295
Ate it?

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,463
Yum!

121
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,299
Halos are edible?

122
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,552
Was it good?
What did it taste like?

123
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,096
The best sauce for it?
How's the texture?

124
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,099
How should I know?
I'm not the one who ate it.

125
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,768
What would a halo taste like?

126
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,187
It must be fluffy like meringue.

127
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,524
Velvety soft like fish roe.

128
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,694
And of course, oh, so sweet

129
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,113
like vanilla ice cream.

130
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,742
Wait, does that mean you can't
go back to Heaven either?

131
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,538
Yup, and I never told anyone
I was coming down here.

132
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,499
I guess I'll just have to wait until it regenerates.

133
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,501
I see...

134
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,713
Wait, regenerate?

135
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,757
How did you not know?

136
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,719
Our halos regenerate over time.

137
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,598
Were you really a high-level angel?

138
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,727
But there's no way to know
how long it will take.

139
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,771
Could be days, could be years.

140
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,398
I see.

141
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,152
In that case,
let's hope someone finds us here.

142
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,531
We've got no choice
but to survive in this world.

143
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,825
I guess so.

144
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,717
Let's cease fire between us for now

145
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,471
and work together
to survive in the human world!

146
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,848
You gotta be kidding me.

147
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,852
I don't need your help for anything.

148
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,395
Plus, you're too naive.

149
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,482
You'll only be a burden
when it comes to survival.

150
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,319
So that's that.
I'd much rather be a lone wolf.

151
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,282
On that note, I'll take my leave.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,504
Thought this was a halo?
Fooled you!

153
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,839
It's a baumkuchen.

154
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,804
Is Poporon really going to be okay by herself?

155
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,141
Today, Japan ranks at 40th in the world
as the best place to live,

156
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,519
and where foreigners want to live.

157
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,813
Fifty-first for its happiness level.

158
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,607
Number three as the devil's most desired
place to live.

159
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,903
And it's ranked 78
as an angel's most desired place to live.

160
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,996
I'm so close...

161
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,085
A fake coin?

162
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,129
Dear God!

163
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,426
Earn 2000 yen per hour
by cleaning people's ears on your lap.

164
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,677
It's so easy!

165
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,846
Sounds fair to me.

166
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,389
I'm in!

167
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:03,770
Earn 50,000 yen by taking pills on a schedule,
in this building, for a month!

168
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,355
With that kind of money,

169
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,275
I could buy 71 copies
of 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.

170
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,360
Just by selling handshake event tickets!

171
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:15,324
Prey on wealthy-looking otaku
and get them to buy art, easy!

172
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,159
You'd get a good cut.

173
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,454
A pretty girl like you would make a killing!
You in?

174
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,789
I'm really tempted.

175
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,126
WE WILL BUY DVD - BD
ENTRANCE

176
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,838
MARI SHIRAISHI'S NEW RELEASE!

177
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,509
You're out-of-this-world cute,
like an angel!

178
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,847
I've got a great gig
reserved for pretty girls just like you.

179
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,390
So, what do you say?

180
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,808
Really?

181
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,854
Good grief.

182
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,025
She has no idea
what she's getting herself into.

183
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,031
She's a bit of a brat, but...

184
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,744
As an angel, I can't just abandon her.

185
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,372
I gotta convince her
to team up with me.

186
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:08,668
Plus, a decent employer wouldn't hire anyone
without a background check!

187
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,045
Thank you very much.

188
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,338
That was great.

189
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,883
Here's the ramen and fried rice.

190
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,051
You're adorable!

191
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,844
Oh, stop it.

192
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,846
Guess I was wrong.

193
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,523
Drink your mapo tofu!

194
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,443
-Here.
-Thanks!

195
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,611
Peanuts.

196
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,071
Ogre's coming.

197
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,656
Ogre?

198
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,284
I summoned him from Hell for Setsubun,
the spring ritual.

199
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,079
You guys celebrate Setsubun in Hell too?

200
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,247
We sure do!

201
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,959
At the end, you eat the same
number of beans as your age.

202
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,128
That's easier said than done!

203
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,588
Give me water!

204
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,841
I can't eat anymore...

205
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,470
That's just like Japan.

206
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,015
Ogre should be here by now.

207
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:09,146
Yurine, when he shows up,
throw the peanuts at him so he doesn't come in.

208
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,440
We'll be blessed with luck all year,

209
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,944
with victory after victory
on the slots-- Finally!

210
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:21,283
I'm sorry. Please accept my apologies
for my tardiness.

211
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,202
There's no excuse for tardiness,
damn Ogre!

212
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,580
Devils out! Fortune in!

213
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,707
Devils out! Fortune in!

214
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,916
Enough!

215
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,712
How could you be so cruel
to something so cute?

216
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,089
But this is my job, miss.

217
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,674
Dummy!

218
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,469
Don't bring him inside!

219
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,554
It'll ward away our fortune!

220
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,682
Great, another penniless year.

221
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,477
You're the one who wards off the fortune.

222
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,480
I got scolded because of you!

223
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,732
Like I said...

224
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,319
Jashin-chan...

225
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,197
If you bully him again,
I'll trim your meat

226
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,240
bit by bit with a kebab knife.

227
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,077
Stop! Please! I beg you!

228
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,248
I'm sorry. I'll stop bullying.

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,877
Good. Let's go back to the ritual, shall we?

230
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,504
Ready?

231
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,840
But not with the little guy again.

232
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,467
Hold him for a sec.

233
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,762
What's that?

234
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,597
A specialized bean gun.

235
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,765
No!

236
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,018
Devils out!

237
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,612
Boy, that felt great.

238
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,031
I feel that fortune coming in.

239
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,370
Minos took responsibility
and ate all the peanuts thrown.

240
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,998
What? Fine. I'll eat it all-- All?

241
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,126
Damn Ogre!

242
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,171
Has no respect for high-class devils!

243
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,467
Thanks to Yurine,
the Setsubun ritual was a bust.

244
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,636
So annoying.

245
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,347
Now I gotta find someone weaker to bully.

246
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,140
Fresh and delicious!

247
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,773
The stores are pushing ehomaki
as a seasonal item,

248
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,733
but it hasn't caught on yet.

249
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,655
They even sell ehomaki-style roll cakes
and push them as sweet ehomaki.

250
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,449
But that hasn't caught on at all.

251
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,661
The future of ehomaki looks gloomy!

252
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,795
It's freezing.

253
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,383
Physical labor every day

254
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,970
is taxing on the body and mind.

255
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,848
And I barely make any money.

256
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,225
What has become of this country?

257
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:57,564
This is why Japan ranks second as the country
where people get the least amount of sleep.

258
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,567
People here take the least paid leave too.

259
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,528
It ranks 114 in countries without gender gaps.

260
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,072
Second as the devil's most desired place to live.

261
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,493
While it's 145 as an angel's
most desired place to live.

262
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,787
Devils out.

263
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,497
Angels die.

264
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,333
Hey, quit that!

265
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,503
Did this pest really have to
show up now?

266
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,841
Don't let food go to waste.

267
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,635
That's not like you.

268
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,136
WASTE LIVES NOT FOOD.

269
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,764
Yup, that's my philosophy!

270
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,807
It's still perfectly edible.

271
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,020
Forget the three-second rule,
I go by the 30-second rule.

272
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,480
You're fine.

273
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,941
Just peel off the shell like this, see?

274
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,278
It's good!

275
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,863
There's some here.

276
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,782
Over here too!

277
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,535
-Take the whole bag.
-What?

278
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,079
This too.

279
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,374
-Yurine made me bring it to you.
-So long!

280
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,085
A hand roll?

281
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,920
It's called ehomaki.

282
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,549
It brings you good fortune if you
eat it facing the lucky direction.

283
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,802
This year, you gotta face that way.

284
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,262
Don't eat it in your cardboard house.

285
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,597
It'll poke out.

286
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,808
I'll have it outside.

287
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,559
I'm done here.

288
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,895
I gotta make one for Yurine now.

289
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,814
What?

290
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,566
Thank you.

291
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,324
-Ehomaki, yum!
-Eho...

292
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,034
That way, right?

293
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,787
All right, here I go.

294
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,456
Fortune, come to me...

295
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,918
30-second rule!

296
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,592
Delicious! I can already feel
the good fortune coming.

297
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,095
She just ate food from the ground!

298
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,224
Now she's choking on it!

299
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,726
Watch and learn.

300
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,895
Come on, even I know
not to eat food off the ground.

301
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,903
Wait, was I just on my way to Heaven?

302
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,739
Am I imagining things?

303
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,410
Good fortune, where are you?

304
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,710
Too cute!

305
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,337
You used Medusa's credit card number

306
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,383
and spent 100,000 yen
on social-network games?

307
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,052
The slots aren't enough for you?

308
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,139
You tried to borrow
even more money yesterday.

309
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,475
Time to be disappear...

310
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,312
You're not going anywhere.

311
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,859
Medusa! How could you
rat me out like that?

312
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,113
I was worried
you were becoming a game junkie!

313
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,034
That's none of your business!
You act like you're the victim!

314
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,536
Medusa is the victim.

315
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,917
Why would you give her
your card number?

316
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,628
It wasn't my PIN
so I thought it was okay.

317
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,046
Be more cautious.

318
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,049
Hey, don't bully Medusa.

319
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,721
You know you're only enabling
her bad habits.

320
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,933
Get a new card
as soon as you get back to Hell.

321
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,142
Okay.

322
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,435
Oh, Jesus.

323
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,355
You always get Medusa
involved in your mess.

324
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,816
I'll pay her back eventually.

325
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,735
How can you without a job?

326
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,075
Sell clothes I don't wear.

327
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,451
Sold!

328
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,955
Borrow more from Medusa
to bet on horses?

329
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,957
Go! Go! Pass that horse!

330
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,668
Or else you'd better run for your life!

331
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:53,174
Why don't you have any ambition
to go out and work for your money?

332
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,679
You don't even have clothes.

333
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,349
You hopeless...

334
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,560
A game notification!

335
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,812
Did I fully recover?

336
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:14,529
Don't you dare look at your phone
while I'm talking to you.

337
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,615
No! My poor finger!

338
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,285
No sign of remorse whatsoever.

339
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,453
Are you okay?

340
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,248
My hand... It hurts...

341
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,876
It'll regenerate eventually.

342
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,169
I won't last any longer.

343
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,463
Don't give up, Jashin-chan!

344
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,675
-I have one last wish...
-What is it?

345
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,303
You have two credit cards, right?

346
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,637
I do.

347
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,141
Text me your other card number...

348
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,687
You never learn.

349
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,234
No, not the chainsaw!

350
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,652
That's enough.

351
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,070
I've had it with you.

352
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,284
The end.

353
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,661
Where did you send her?

354
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,796
Where am I?

355
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,549
JULY 9TH
17:00

356
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,636
It's right before yesterday's sale.

357
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,182
I still have the 10,000 yen
I spent yesterday.

358
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,018
I must have traveled back in time!

359
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,439
There was a wormhole
beneath Yurine's apartment!

360
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,860
Hooray, God answered my prayers!

361
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:42,450
This must be a test.
I shouldn't repeat my mistakes.

362
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,958
Play... Play...

363
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,461
Or maybe they sent me back here...

364
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,255
so I could win this time...

365
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,383
Yeah, of course I'll win!

366
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,010
I'll beat all the odds!

367
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,972
I'm gonna rewrite history!

368
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,598
Watch me, Yurine.

369
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,852
I'll bring home a fancy
hot-pot dinner tonight!

370
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,899
Jashin-chan rewrote history.

371
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,861
She strayed into a never-ending time loop.

372
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,156
How many loops will she have gone through

373
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,659
by the time we see her next?

374
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:30,790
We shall meet again
once she recognizes her mistake.

375
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,752
Though, there's no telling when that might be...

376
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,864
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

377
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:07,785
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

378
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:13,082
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

379
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,503
As she starves to death

380
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,048
It's a love and hate relationship

381
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,341
Can't leave each other alone

382
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,971
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

383
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,184
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

384
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,603
Test my heart, don't stop

385
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:40,693
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

386
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,073
We're a happy family

387
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:49,202
Let me say, I love you

388
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,662
When all is said and done

389
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:56,250
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

390
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:01,005
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

391
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,257
For another crazy tomorrow

392
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,969
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

393
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,060
What's wrong, Jashin-chan?

394
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,814
I ran out of content...

395
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,526
It's okay.

396
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,155
Everyone's happy watching you
be your cute self.

397
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,824
So come on,

398
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,119
show them your bright smile.

399
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,537
Okay?

400
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,955
Medusa...

401
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,752
That's your smile?

402
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,673
The iron-made container delivered from afar

403
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,509
was an iron maiden of Elizabeth Báthory.

404
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,595
And now, it embraces the devils.

405
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,556
Dropkick on My Devil!

406
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,559
We'll dragon-screw into your heart
in the next episode too!

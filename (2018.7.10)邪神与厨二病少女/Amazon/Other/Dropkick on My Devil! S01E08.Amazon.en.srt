1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:05,109
Won't leave

2
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:10,907
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,996
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,011
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,597
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:36,432
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:40,186
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,021
If you go too far

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,067
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,403
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,490
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,786
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:00,873
I'll never give up

14
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:06,713
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,632
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:13,052
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:18,141
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,352
But until then

20
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:27,317
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:45,460
JULY 9TH

22
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:54,218
LIFE THEATER

23
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,520
The Goddess of Victory
smiles upon me.

24
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:10,693
JULY 9TH
17:24

25
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,493
Lost big time, yet again.

26
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:22,372
I should've resisted the urge!

27
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,833
What the hell was I thinking?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,629
How could I go completely broke
in just 30 minutes?

29
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,590
This alley is dangerous.

30
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:36,761
I only took this shortcut
so I wouldn't miss the sale!

31
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:41,891
But my right hand insisted
that I play the slots.

32
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,436
Stop it! That's enough!

33
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,189
Life is so cruel!

34
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,360
Dear God, take me back in time,
before I stepped inside to play.

35
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,070
Please!

36
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:55,696
JASHIN-CHAN LIFE THEATER
FIN

37
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:56,989
Jashin-chan!

38
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,491
There you are, my ATM.

39
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,661
I was just on my way to see you.

40
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,163
I brought you Fresh Moon,
your favorite.

41
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,749
Fresh Moon?

42
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,459
Fresh...?

43
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:09,961
New...?

44
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,088
Moon? A new moon?

45
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,006
A fresh start.

46
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:16,300
This is my moment.

47
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,219
When shall I seize it?

48
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:19,470
Now's the time!

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,431
Are you okay?

50
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:24,976
I beg you.

51
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,520
Lend me 20,000 yen!

52
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,897
I'll double it for you!

53
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,691
Sucker!

54
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,570
You idiot!

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,072
You really pushed your luck today.

56
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:40,491
And came out a broke loser.

57
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:44,871
You even had the gall
to spend our dinner budget.

58
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,248
I have no choice
but to kill you.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,584
Medusa, help me!

60
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,169
Please forgive her!

61
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,171
She's sorry!

62
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:55,256
She's a good girl by nature.

63
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:57,008
Right, Jashin-chan?

64
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:01,387
See? Look at that pure smile.

65
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,016
My face...

66
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,852
She's corrupt by nature.

67
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,770
Are you all right?

68
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,397
Not at all.

69
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:14,358
I give you an allowance.

70
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,070
-Limit yourself to that money.
-Okay.

71
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:21,741
Make sure you pay Medusa back
her 20,000 yen too.

72
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,452
TOO BROKE TO PAY BACK

73
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,621
No excuses.

74
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:27,830
Roger that!

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,416
Don't worry, pay me back
when you can.

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,543
Quit spoiling her, Medusa.

77
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,216
The money you blew?
It's coming out of your allowance.

78
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,511
Redeem yourself.
Go get the groceries this time.

79
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,012
You got it!

80
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:46,057
I won't disappoint you this time!

81
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,018
I promise never to give in
to my demons again!

82
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,729
Jashin-chan...

83
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,397
Should I go with you?

84
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,151
No need.

85
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:59,987
I reap what I sow.

86
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,240
Then I will earn her trust back!

87
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,158
That's the spirit!

88
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,537
Catch you later!

89
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:14,961
Jashin-chan...
Where could she be?

90
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:19,590
What is this?

91
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,763
What a shame.

92
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,351
Japan's supposed to be the country
with the 13th-best air quality in the world.

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,779
What's taking her so long?

94
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,239
Think she...?

95
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,159
Let's believe in her.
I know she's a good girl.

96
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,997
Don't strike out on life
with gambling and blow!

97
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,251
Jashin-chan dropkick!

98
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:56,711
In the park!

99
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,841
Thanks for the bread crusts!

100
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,050
Later!

101
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,510
I know you get fed!

102
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,846
So why steal from me?

103
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,182
That was three days' worth of food...

104
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:13,519
Oh, Pekola, what a sorry sight.

105
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:15,938
Poporon.

106
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,651
I was ready to crack open
that devil's head

107
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,361
but she ran off.

108
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,196
But, wait a minute...

109
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:25,781
Just the other day,

110
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,743
the devil came by
to drop off curry for Pekola.

111
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,161
Could it be...

112
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,623
Did you befriend a devil
even though you're an angel?

113
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,923
Seriously?

114
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,009
Pekola...

115
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,639
It's not like that.

116
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,643
We're not friends or anything.

117
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,813
What happened to your halo?

118
00:06:58,356 --> 00:06:59,649
That devil ate mine.

119
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:00,816
Ate it?

120
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:01,942
Yum!

121
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,820
Halos are edible?

122
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:07,031
Was it good?
What did it taste like?

123
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,617
The best sauce for it?
How's the texture?

124
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,620
How should I know?
I'm not the one who ate it.

125
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:15,289
What would a halo taste like?

126
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,708
It must be fluffy like meringue.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,003
Velvety soft like fish roe.

128
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:24,173
And of course, oh, so sweet

129
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,592
like vanilla ice cream.

130
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:31,222
Wait, does that mean you can't
go back to Heaven either?

131
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:35,059
Yup, and I never told anyone
I was coming down here.

132
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,020
I guess I'll just have to wait until it regenerates.

133
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,980
I see...

134
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:43,192
Wait, regenerate?

135
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,278
How did you not know?

136
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,240
Our halos regenerate over time.

137
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:53,119
Were you really a high-level angel?

138
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:57,248
But there's no way to know
how long it will take.

139
00:07:57,373 --> 00:08:00,251
Could be days, could be years.

140
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,919
I see.

141
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,631
In that case,
let's hope someone finds us here.

142
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,010
We've got no choice
but to survive in this world.

143
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,346
I guess so.

144
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,238
Let's cease fire between us for now

145
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:32,950
and work together
to survive in the human world!

146
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,369
You gotta be kidding me.

147
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:39,331
I don't need your help for anything.

148
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,916
Plus, you're too naive.

149
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,961
You'll only be a burden
when it comes to survival.

150
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:47,840
So that's that.
I'd much rather be a lone wolf.

151
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:52,762
On that note, I'll take my leave.

152
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,983
Thought this was a halo?
Fooled you!

153
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,360
It's a baumkuchen.

154
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:14,283
Is Poporon really going to be okay by herself?

155
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,621
Today, Japan ranks at 40th in the world
as the best place to live,

156
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,040
and where foreigners want to live.

157
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,292
Fifty-first for its happiness level.

158
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:26,128
Number three as the devil's most desired
place to live.

159
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:30,382
And it's ranked 78
as an angel's most desired place to live.

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,517
I'm so close...

161
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,606
A fake coin?

162
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:47,650
Dear God!

163
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:52,947
Earn 2000 yen per hour
by cleaning people's ears on your lap.

164
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,198
It's so easy!

165
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,367
Sounds fair to me.

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,910
I'm in!

167
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:04,250
Earn 50,000 yen by taking pills on a schedule,
in this building, for a month!

168
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,876
With that kind of money,

169
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,796
I could buy 71 copies
of 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.

170
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,840
Just by selling handshake event tickets!

171
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:15,803
Prey on wealthy-looking otaku
and get them to buy art, easy!

172
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,680
You'd get a good cut.

173
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,933
A pretty girl like you would make a killing!
You in?

174
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,310
I'm really tempted.

175
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,647
WE WILL BUY DVD - BD
ENTRANCE

176
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,359
MARI SHIRAISHI'S NEW RELEASE!

177
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:35,030
You're out-of-this-world cute,
like an angel!

178
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:39,368
I've got a great gig
reserved for pretty girls just like you.

179
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,870
So, what do you say?

180
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:42,329
Really?

181
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,333
Good grief.

182
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:50,546
She has no idea
what she's getting herself into.

183
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,510
She's a bit of a brat, but...

184
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:01,223
As an angel, I can't just abandon her.

185
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,851
I gotta convince her
to team up with me.

186
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:09,189
Plus, a decent employer wouldn't hire anyone
without a background check!

187
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,566
Thank you very much.

188
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:11,859
That was great.

189
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:15,362
Here's the ramen and fried rice.

190
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,530
You're adorable!

191
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,324
Oh, stop it.

192
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,367
Guess I was wrong.

193
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,002
Drink your mapo tofu!

194
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,923
-Here.
-Thanks!

195
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,090
Peanuts.

196
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,550
Ogre's coming.

197
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,177
Ogre?

198
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:41,764
I summoned him from Hell for Setsubun,
the spring ritual.

199
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,600
You guys celebrate Setsubun in Hell too?

200
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,768
We sure do!

201
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:49,480
At the end, you eat the same
number of beans as your age.

202
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,649
That's easier said than done!

203
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,109
Give me water!

204
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,320
I can't eat anymore...

205
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,950
That's just like Japan.

206
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,536
Ogre should be here by now.

207
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:09,667
Yurine, when he shows up,
throw the peanuts at him so he doesn't come in.

208
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,961
We'll be blessed with luck all year,

209
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:16,423
with victory after victory
on the slots-- Finally!

210
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,762
I'm sorry. Please accept my apologies
for my tardiness.

211
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,682
There's no excuse for tardiness,
damn Ogre!

212
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,101
Devils out! Fortune in!

213
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:29,228
Devils out! Fortune in!

214
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:30,437
Enough!

215
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,191
How could you be so cruel
to something so cute?

216
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,610
But this is my job, miss.

217
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,153
Dummy!

218
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,990
Don't bring him inside!

219
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,033
It'll ward away our fortune!

220
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,161
Great, another penniless year.

221
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,998
You're the one who wards off the fortune.

222
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:52,001
I got scolded because of you!

223
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,211
Like I said...

224
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,840
Jashin-chan...

225
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,718
If you bully him again,
I'll trim your meat

226
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,720
bit by bit with a kebab knife.

227
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:06,598
Stop! Please! I beg you!

228
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,769
I'm sorry. I'll stop bullying.

229
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,398
Good. Let's go back to the ritual, shall we?

230
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,983
Ready?

231
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:19,319
But not with the little guy again.

232
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:20,988
Hold him for a sec.

233
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,241
What's that?

234
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,118
A specialized bean gun.

235
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:27,286
No!

236
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,539
Devils out!

237
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:41,091
Boy, that felt great.

238
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,510
I feel that fortune coming in.

239
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,891
Minos took responsibility
and ate all the peanuts thrown.

240
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:52,519
What? Fine. I'll eat it all-- All?

241
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,647
Damn Ogre!

242
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,650
Has no respect for high-class devils!

243
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:02,988
Thanks to Yurine,
the Setsubun ritual was a bust.

244
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,157
So annoying.

245
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,868
Now I gotta find someone weaker to bully.

246
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,620
Fresh and delicious!

247
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:17,252
The stores are pushing ehomaki
as a seasonal item,

248
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,213
but it hasn't caught on yet.

249
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:24,176
They even sell ehomaki-style roll cakes
and push them as sweet ehomaki.

250
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:26,970
But that hasn't caught on at all.

251
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:30,140
The future of ehomaki looks gloomy!

252
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:39,316
It's freezing.

253
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,862
Physical labor every day

254
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:47,491
is taxing on the body and mind.

255
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,369
And I barely make any money.

256
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,746
What has become of this country?

257
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:58,043
This is why Japan ranks second as the country
where people get the least amount of sleep.

258
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,088
People here take the least paid leave too.

259
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:04,049
It ranks 114 in countries without gender gaps.

260
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,552
Second as the devil's most desired place to live.

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,973
While it's 145 as an angel's
most desired place to live.

262
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:13,308
Devils out.

263
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,018
Angels die.

264
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,812
Hey, quit that!

265
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,983
Did this pest really have to
show up now?

266
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:25,320
Don't let food go to waste.

267
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:27,156
That's not like you.

268
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,657
WASTE LIVES NOT FOOD.

269
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,243
Yup, that's my philosophy!

270
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,328
It's still perfectly edible.

271
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,541
Forget the three-second rule,
I go by the 30-second rule.

272
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,001
You're fine.

273
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:42,421
Just peel off the shell like this, see?

274
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:45,799
It's good!

275
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,342
There's some here.

276
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:49,261
Over here too!

277
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:53,056
-Take the whole bag.
-What?

278
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,600
This too.

279
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,853
-Yurine made me bring it to you.
-So long!

280
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:00,606
A hand roll?

281
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,441
It's called ehomaki.

282
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,070
It brings you good fortune if you
eat it facing the lucky direction.

283
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,281
This year, you gotta face that way.

284
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,742
Don't eat it in your cardboard house.

285
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,118
It'll poke out.

286
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,329
I'll have it outside.

287
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm done here.

288
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,416
I gotta make one for Yurine now.

289
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,293
What?

290
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,087
Thank you.

291
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:31,803
-Ehomaki, yum!
-Eho...

292
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,513
That way, right?

293
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:36,308
All right, here I go.

294
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,977
Fortune, come to me...

295
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:42,439
30-second rule!

296
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:50,072
Delicious! I can already feel
the good fortune coming.

297
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:52,616
She just ate food from the ground!

298
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:56,703
Now she's choking on it!

299
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,247
Watch and learn.

300
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,416
Come on, even I know
not to eat food off the ground.

301
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:09,383
Wait, was I just on my way to Heaven?

302
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,260
Am I imagining things?

303
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:15,931
Good fortune, where are you?

304
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,231
Too cute!

305
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,858
You used Medusa's credit card number

306
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:30,862
and spent 100,000 yen
on social-network games?

307
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,532
The slots aren't enough for you?

308
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,660
You tried to borrow
even more money yesterday.

309
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:38,996
Time to be disappear...

310
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,791
You're not going anywhere.

311
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:48,380
Medusa! How could you
rat me out like that?

312
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,592
I was worried
you were becoming a game junkie!

313
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,513
That's none of your business!
You act like you're the victim!

314
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,057
Medusa is the victim.

315
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:04,438
Why would you give her
your card number?

316
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:07,149
It wasn't my PIN
so I thought it was okay.

317
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,567
Be more cautious.

318
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,570
Hey, don't bully Medusa.

319
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,200
You know you're only enabling
her bad habits.

320
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:20,412
Get a new card
as soon as you get back to Hell.

321
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,621
Okay.

322
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:22,956
Oh, Jesus.

323
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,876
You always get Medusa
involved in your mess.

324
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,337
I'll pay her back eventually.

325
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,256
How can you without a job?

326
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,596
Sell clothes I don't wear.

327
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:38,930
Sold!

328
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:42,476
Borrow more from Medusa
to bet on horses?

329
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,478
Go! Go! Pass that horse!

330
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:47,189
Or else you'd better run for your life!

331
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,653
Why don't you have any ambition
to go out and work for your money?

332
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:58,200
You don't even have clothes.

333
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,870
You hopeless...

334
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,081
A game notification!

335
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,291
Did I fully recover?

336
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:15,050
Don't you dare look at your phone
while I'm talking to you.

337
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:18,136
No! My poor finger!

338
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,806
No sign of remorse whatsoever.

339
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,933
Are you okay?

340
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,769
My hand... It hurts...

341
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,397
It'll regenerate eventually.

342
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:30,690
I won't last any longer.

343
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,943
Don't give up, Jashin-chan!

344
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,196
-I have one last wish...
-What is it?

345
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,782
You have two credit cards, right?

346
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,158
I do.

347
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:43,620
Text me your other card number...

348
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,208
You never learn.

349
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,713
No, not the chainsaw!

350
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,132
That's enough.

351
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,550
I've had it with you.

352
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:01,763
The end.

353
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,141
Where did you send her?

354
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:14,317
Where am I?

355
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,070
JULY 9TH
17:00

356
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:20,157
It's right before yesterday's sale.

357
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:24,661
I still have the 10,000 yen
I spent yesterday.

358
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,539
I must have traveled back in time!

359
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:31,960
There was a wormhole
beneath Yurine's apartment!

360
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,339
Hooray, God answered my prayers!

361
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:42,929
This must be a test.
I shouldn't repeat my mistakes.

362
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,479
Play... Play...

363
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:53,940
Or maybe they sent me back here...

364
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,776
so I could win this time...

365
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:58,862
Yeah, of course I'll win!

366
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,490
I'll beat all the odds!

367
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:04,451
I'm gonna rewrite history!

368
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,119
Watch me, Yurine.

369
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:10,332
I'll bring home a fancy
hot-pot dinner tonight!

370
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,420
Jashin-chan rewrote history.

371
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,341
She strayed into a never-ending time loop.

372
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:22,677
How many loops will she have gone through

373
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:25,180
by the time we see her next?

374
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,311
We shall meet again
once she recognizes her mistake.

375
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:35,232
Though, there's no telling when that might be...

376
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:03,343
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

377
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,306
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

378
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:13,562
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

379
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,983
As she starves to death

380
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,569
It's a love and hate relationship

381
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:22,821
Can't leave each other alone

382
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:27,450
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

383
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:31,663
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

384
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:34,082
Test my heart, don't stop

385
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:41,172
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

386
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:45,552
We're a happy family

387
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,681
Let me say, I love you

388
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,142
When all is said and done

389
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,730
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

390
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:01,526
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

391
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:03,778
For another crazy tomorrow

392
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:07,490
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

393
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,581
What's wrong, Jashin-chan?

394
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,293
I ran out of content...

395
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,047
It's okay.

396
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:26,676
Everyone's happy watching you
be your cute self.

397
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,303
So come on,

398
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:31,640
show them your bright smile.

399
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,058
Okay?

400
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,476
Medusa...

401
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,231
That's your smile?

402
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:44,152
The iron-made container delivered from afar

403
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,030
was an iron maiden of Elizabeth Báthory.

404
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:50,117
And now, it embraces the devils.

405
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,077
Dropkick on My Devil!

406
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:55,080
We'll dragon-screw into your heart
in the next episode too!

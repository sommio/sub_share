1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,754
The principles of a devil summoning.

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,717
A devil summoned by sorcery

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,761
must be sent back by sorcery.

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,682
The human summoner becomes
the devil's master.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,810
As long as the summoner lives,

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,021
the devil is bound
to the human world.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,901
-Got a package for ya!
-Thank you.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,696
-I-It was just a dream.
-Please sign here.

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:33,284
-A dream? No, more like...
-Thanks, have a great day!

10
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,619
-It's wrong to lie.
-You too.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,624
Won’t leave

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:46,422
without a dropkick on her!

13
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,470
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

14
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:07,485
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

15
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,112
I gotta kill her or else
What?

16
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,989
I can’t go back to Hell!
Sister...

17
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,701
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,620
If you go too far,

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,624
I’ll slice you up completely!

20
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,876
Your halo!
Must get it back!

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,005
Never miss a chance
Hey, seriously?

22
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:32,218
To attack her from behind!
You’re so mean.

23
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,472
I’ll never give up.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,098
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

25
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:42,269
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

26
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,189
Huh? What? I missed…

27
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,609
Can’t leave Earth

28
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:53,531
without a dropkick on her!

29
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,909
But until then,

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,832
let’s all have fun together!
Yeah!

31
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,421
Tokyo, the big city.

32
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,174
In the corner of this world,

33
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,428
another day of bittersweet drama

34
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,347
is about to unfold.

35
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,328
Let the hot pot party begin!

36
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,959
You're all in for a treat!
It's grade A beef!

37
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,837
It's not like you bought it.

38
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,423
D-Don't sweat the details.

39
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,008
Let's get started!

40
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:58,262
After heating up the pot,
we grease it with beef tallow.

41
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,600
Then, we'll grill the green onions!

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,768
Work up that appetite!

43
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,645
Smells delicious!

44
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,981
It smells wonderful!

45
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,485
We'll take them out once they brown
so we can grill the meat.

46
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,573
Please, God, forgive me.

47
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,744
Forgive me for attending
a witch's Sabbath when I'm an angel.

48
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:25,623
Yurine Hanazono, you kidnapped me
when I was starving.

49
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,249
What are you scheming?

50
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,835
No matter how hungry I am,

51
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,588
I can't face God after this!

52
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,592
Make sure both sides are cooked.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,261
Meat, meat, I love meat!

54
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,889
Once it's fully cooked,
it's time for...

55
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,100
Jashin-chan's special stock!

56
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,353
We'll pour this right in!

57
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,776
U-Unbelievable.

58
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,029
Today's stock is especially divine!

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,865
I must be a genius!

60
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,076
Now we put in the veggies,

61
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,411
cook them until brown,
and it's done!

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,914
-I'm jealous, Yurine.
-Let me help you.

63
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,709
You have generous relatives who send
you quality meat.

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,671
It's not a regular thing.

65
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,922
That's right!

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,176
-We rarely have meat in hot pots.
-Huh?

67
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,345
It's usually full of veggies.

68
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,097
NO MEAT

69
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,848
Guess I was lucky today.

70
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,269
Why don't you get your relatives
to send us some meat in return?

71
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,732
Because that'll make us cannibals.

72
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,236
Ah, the hot pot's almost ready.

73
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,156
Looks delicious.

74
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,784
Here, Pekola, here's your egg.

75
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,453
-Thanks.
-Now dig in!

76
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,746
Let's eat!

77
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,915
I've no choice.

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,376
I'm starving.

79
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,087
-God will forgive me.
-Delicious!

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,715
It just melts in my mouth!

81
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,550
It's all right.

82
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,804
Pekola! What are you doing here?

83
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,515
This is a devil's dinner.

84
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,684
Coming from Heaven,

85
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,021
you're forbidden to eat with us,
aren't you?

86
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,690
Wait, Pekola's an angel?

87
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,609
-Seriously?
-But you invited me.

88
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,947
-Hey! Come by tonight for hot pot!
-Hot pot?

89
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,198
Jashin-chan...

90
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,867
You fool.

91
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,077
W-Who are you calling a fool?

92
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,248
She's the one who lost her halo
and can't go back to Heaven!

93
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,624
T-That's...

94
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,501
Enough already.

95
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,920
Shut up! Not another word!

96
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,131
-Jashin-chan...
-What?

97
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,009
-Let's just enjoy our meal.
-But!

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,345
Do not ruin this meal.

99
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,598
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,977
Just kidding! Forget everything.
Let's enjoy our meal.

101
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,854
W-What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,066
Here! Let me make your plate
for you!

103
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,359
-We're best friends!
-Jashin-chan...

104
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,569
Such a handful.

105
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,154
Here ya go, fallen angel.

106
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
VEGGIES

107
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,657
Not one slice of meat...

108
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,244
Can't go wrong
with Wagyu beef, right?

109
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,705
May I get some meat too?

110
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,915
Rule number one.

111
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,544
Finish everything in your bowl
before you go for seconds.

112
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,171
My house, my rules.

113
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,256
Oh, it's out of this world!

114
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,467
So tender and juicy...

115
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,805
And I'm an angel,
not a fallen angel...

116
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,309
-Delicious!
-The veggies are good, but...

117
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,896
-Scrumptious!
-They're good, but...

118
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,524
The meat...

119
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,821
Cow...horse...

120
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,330
Finally...

121
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,999
Bok choy sure does fill you up.

122
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,293
-It's time--
-You finished, Pekola!

123
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,962
Let me get that for you!

124
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,172
Here ya go, fallen angel.

125
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,007
Bon appétit.

126
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,803
Jashin-chan, cut the bullying!

127
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,014
You're such a child.

128
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,683
See what I mean?

129
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,435
Here, Pekola, say, "Ah."

130
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,945
How is it?

131
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,446
Delicious.

132
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,323
I'm so glad.

133
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,325
A-An angel.

134
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,953
So who exactly is the angel here?

135
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,706
Here, Pekola, have some more meat.

136
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,167
Don't worry about the rules.

137
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,210
There.

138
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,422
Damn it!
You're all spoiling her rotten!

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,843
Medusa, Minos, you're both devils!
Why are you taking the angel's side?

140
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,428
Ignore her.

141
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,139
Y-Yurine...

142
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,267
If you're gonna play it like that...

143
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,147
I'll just have to eat all the meat!

144
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,874
-The meat...
-Hey...

145
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,167
Don't do it...

146
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,254
All done!

147
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,714
J-J-Jashin-chan!

148
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,676
-The meat...
-How could you?

149
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,678
It used to be

150
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,931
a hot pot full of meat.

151
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,142
Our lovely meal...

152
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,810
Jashin-chan...

153
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,813
How will you pay for this?

154
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,442
You won't get away with this.

155
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,863
What? You wanna try me? Huh?

156
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,324
I-I'll go buy more meat!

157
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,328
There's not enough meat, you see?

158
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,956
I'll end you first!

159
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm stuck here thanks to you.
All that resentment

160
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,589
caused by you summoning me
is gonna end you right now!

161
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,008
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

162
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,886
The first episode
is also the season finale!

163
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,597
Enjoy the rest as highlights!

164
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,020
Damn you, reptile.

165
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,235
Damn it! No! No! No!

166
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,655
How about some freshly sliced snake?

167
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,906
There's plenty.

168
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,242
I'll go buy more meat.

169
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,451
Too late now.

170
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,204
-Wonder if it's any good?
-Yurine Hanazono.

171
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,039
Never mess with her.

172
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,546
Snake meat!
It's actually pretty good!

173
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,764
-What's the password?
-Huh?

174
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,476
-Um...
-Rhymes with Hannibal...

175
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,186
Cannibal.

176
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,272
You may enter!

177
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,901
Don't scare me!
Jashin-chan, you're too paranoid.

178
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,946
Never underestimate the human world.

179
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,369
Jashin-chan,
I've been thinking these days...

180
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,455
What about?

181
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,624
-This....
-No way!

182
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,626
You really got it for me!

183
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,879
Huh?

184
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,381
Jashin-chan.

185
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,009
-You're up to no good, right?
-Yup.

186
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,013
Idiot.
What the hell do you think this is?

187
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,057
You can't have it!

188
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,476
-I saw the news.
-The criminal escaped.

189
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,604
According to police investigation,

190
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,230
the weapon used...

191
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,857
The weapon...

192
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,734
Surprise, surprise!

193
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,489
This weapon often gets
featured in crime reports.

194
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,867
A crowbar!

195
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,244
I figured it out.

196
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,246
As I slept and ate all day,

197
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,084
woke up and watched TV all day,

198
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,336
I noticed how the crowbar

199
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,130
would get featured on TV
almost daily!

200
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:17,427
That's right! It's because
it's the best weapon to use to kill a human!

201
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,846
Yurine's dead meat!

202
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,348
Stop Jashin-chan!

203
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,184
You'll end up killing Yurine!

204
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,521
-Uh, that's the point.
-What?

205
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,525
I'm gonna kill her with one strike!

206
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,694
Ouch! Stop! Forgive me, please!

207
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,030
No way! I'll never forgive you!

208
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,323
ONE STRIKE...?

209
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,411
Her brains will splatter
all over the place!

210
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,748
This is too good.

211
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,459
Plus, the crowbar was purchased
by Medusa.

212
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,964
I'll be innocent,
and didn't pay a penny for it.

213
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,925
It's the perfect crime!

214
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,719
You're like the devil, Jashin-chan!

215
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,305
Last I checked, I am the devil!

216
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,684
Dear God, please give her
divine punishment.

217
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,979
Nice try, but you're a devil too!

218
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,190
I'm back.

219
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,692
Welcome home!

220
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,277
W-Welcome back.

221
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,363
Oh, hey, Medusa. How are you?

222
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,823
Doing well, thanks.

223
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,033
That movie you wanted to watch?

224
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,995
Medusa bought it for us!

225
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,748
You must be tired.
Why don't you go wind down?

226
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,334
Really? Thanks so much, Medusa.

227
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,170
N-No problem.

228
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,422
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

229
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,344
Could I go watch it?

230
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,222
Of course! Please do.

231
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,682
Don't mind us.

232
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,066
Holy shit!

233
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,699
Get into it, Yurine.

234
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,036
Because when you're completely
focused on the movie,

235
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm gonna bust your brains out!

236
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,583
This is the end.

237
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:17,255
Good bye, Yurine.
Viewers, it's your lucky day.

238
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:22,010
You all get to witness human brains

239
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,679
splatter all over the place!

240
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,556
-Gotcha.
-What?

241
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,017
Bam.

242
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,021
-How did she know?
-You said it all out loud.

243
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,481
Long lines, too.

244
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,193
Sound engineer!
It's called internal monologue!

245
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,362
Let's redo this! Cut! Cut!

246
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,239
Who are you talking to?

247
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,573
It was all Medusa!

248
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,910
I resisted
but she threatened me to do it!

249
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,454
Liar! You're unbelievable.

250
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,665
Medusa, you're the liar here!

251
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,584
-You're setting me up!
-I can't watch this.

252
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,837
Jashin-chan.

253
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,591
Need I say more?

254
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,261
D-Damn it.

255
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,557
Now I gotta resort to this.
The ultimate soul-crusher!

256
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,810
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

257
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,114
J-J-J-Jashin-chan?

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,830
I can't get up.

259
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,125
My spine's totally crushed.

260
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,090
What the hell is that?

261
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,593
You failed miserably.

262
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:49,347
So I'm gonna take this opportunity
to treat our viewers

263
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:54,603
to the slaughter of a devil,
where your insides get exposed

264
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,480
-as you get minced.
-No! Yurine, stop!

265
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,692
No! No!

266
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,404
No!

267
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,618
-You're just gonna turn a blind eye?
-Yup.

268
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,749
That day, this room was scarlet red.

269
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,376
Was it red from

270
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,129
the sun setting in the skyline?

271
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,715
Or the minced meat of Jashin-chan?

272
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,134
I don't know!

273
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,180
Jeez, I know I can regenerate myself
but don't just stand there.

274
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,891
Now.

275
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,187
Will Jashin-chan fully recover
during the commercial break?

276
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,689
I have no idea!

277
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,318
The murder weapon used
was the chainsaw itself.

278
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,701
You're still censored.

279
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,996
Don't worry, it'll come off soon.

280
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,251
The room's gonna be spotless too.

281
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,920
You can count on me!

282
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,296
Okay.

283
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,967
I'm gonna splurge tonight for dinner
so come back soon!

284
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,928
See ya later!

285
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,429
Bye.

286
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,354
The censoring was all fake.

287
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,855
Slurp.

288
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,984
Yurine has no idea
that I'm fully recovered.

289
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,361
TOMATO JUICE

290
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,446
Today's her birthday.

291
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,866
I'm gonna invite everyone
for a wild celebration.

292
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,577
For a surprise party to celebrate
Yurine's death!

293
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,665
Plus, my horoscope says
I've got the best luck today!

294
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,874
SCORPIO

295
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,586
I got Medusa to pick up the cake
and my lucky item for the day.

296
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,796
LUCKY ITEM: STUN GUN

297
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm gonna be geared up!

298
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,427
Ah, yeah!
It's gonna be a piece of cake!

299
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,845
Break.

300
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,433
As you requested.

301
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,102
Thanks a lot!

302
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,230
You're always so generous
with your money.

303
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,234
Don't do it, Jashin-chan.
Don't commit any more crimes!

304
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,988
Jashin-chan,
planning on killing Yurine again?

305
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,699
You're gonna end up
paying for it anyway.

306
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,579
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm all geared up today.

307
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,372
-See?
-Huh?

308
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,874
And for the record,

309
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:25,128
I haven't committed
any kind of crime so far.

310
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,839
Since it's been
a consistent failure.

311
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,968
Anyway, let me give you the rundown
of how this is gonna go down.

312
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,848
-I'm back.
-First, clueless Yurine comes home.

313
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,518
-Happy Birthday!
-We distract her with a surprise.

314
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,855
Forgive me, God,
I know I'm an angel, and yet--

315
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,316
Hey! I'm not done here!

316
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,943
We'll distract her.

317
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,738
Then, I come running up
with a present--

318
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,825
Not! It's the stun gun
Medusa picked up for me. Ta-da!

319
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,660
I electrocute her.

320
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,788
And she's paralyzed.

321
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,957
Then, I'll finish her
using the kitchen knife...

322
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,918
By stabbing her in the gut!

323
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,836
The perfect plan.

324
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,714
-What a joke.
-You'll fail again.

325
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,467
No, I won't! My horoscope said so!

326
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,345
-I'm geared up with my lucky item!
-I see.

327
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,224
Yurine... But why...?

328
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,101
You told me to come back soon.

329
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,686
Whoopsie.

330
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,897
Not much of a surprise now, huh?

331
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm so sorry.
I haven't even started cooking yet.

332
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,904
-Medusa threatened me to do this!
-What?

333
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,239
Such a manipulator.

334
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,449
Just give up and apologize.

335
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,743
It's a bit too late for that.

336
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,829
Take this, Yurine!

337
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,123
This is your birthday present
from me!

338
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,708
Die!

339
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,088
What?

340
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,345
What the hell?
An electric shaver for beards?

341
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,347
What are you trying to tell me?

342
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,141
Medusa! You traitor!

343
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,018
I just wanted you to stop...

344
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,895
Cut the crap!

345
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,274
You better do the same, or else...

346
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,111
U-Um... Is that...a stun gun?

347
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,446
You're a bit slow to notice.

348
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,824
But my birthday's October 31st.

349
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,159
I'm a Scorpio, just like you.

350
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,496
SCORPIO
OCTOBER 23RD-NOVEMBER 21ST

351
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,249
All right!
Time to finish decorating!

352
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,710
-Yup.
-I'll prepare dinner.

353
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,379
Jashin-chan... Come on.

354
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,756
Need I say more?

355
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,301
No.

356
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,305
Yurine!

357
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,682
Happy Birthday!

358
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,309
Thank you all.

359
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,394
Here's your egg, Yurine.

360
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,023
-Thanks.
-Let me serve the meat for you.

361
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,658
Delicious. I love the seasoning.

362
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,246
Actually, that's all Jashin-chan.

363
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,373
Really?

364
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,467
Hey, is she gonna be okay?

365
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,388
Oh, she'll be fine.
She can regenerate.

366
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,726
-But...
-Don't worry, she'll regenerate.

367
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,648
Hey, Medusa. Help me.

368
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,107
No way!

369
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,194
-Help me.
-No way!

370
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,281
-Minos...
-Never!

371
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,491
Jashin-chan.

372
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,827
Do you repent?

373
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,415
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

374
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,418
Positive?

375
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,087
Yes!

376
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,423
Fine, then.

377
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,843
I'll forgive you.

378
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,518
Dig in, Jashin-chan.

379
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,980
I still can't move.

380
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,399
I'll feed you.

381
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,903
Medusa prepared
such a great meal for us.

382
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,780
Eat the beef tallow.

383
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,997
So this is what they call,
"the Sabbath."

384
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,545
Are we all ready?

385
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,680
Come on. Give us a smile.

386
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,976
I've had enough today.

387
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,814
I had a pretty good time.

388
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,066
You better say that.

389
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,152
I've sacrificed myself--

390
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,945
Now, smile at the camera.

391
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,573
-Ready?
-If Yurine's a Scorpio like me...

392
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,158
Happy Birthday!

393
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,579
What about my birthday party?

394
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,145
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

395
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,900
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

396
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,237
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

397
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,992
As she starves to death!

398
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,079
It’s a love and hate relationship,

399
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,498
can’t leave each other alone

400
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:58,169
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

401
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,381
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

402
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,759
Test my heart, don’t stop

403
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:11,849
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

404
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,104
We’re a happy family La la la

405
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,358
Let me say, I love you!!

406
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,819
When all is said and done

407
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:27,532
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

408
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,161
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

409
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,372
For another crazy tomorrow

410
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,126
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

411
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,922
When the summer heat is making you melt,

412
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,757
you hear a knock at the door.

413
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:49,512
There is a brutal snow woman who came from hell
that makes even our blood cold.

414
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:54,308
Dropkick on My Devil!
Be prepared to be clotheslined by the next episode too!

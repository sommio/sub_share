1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,732
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:04,817
Telegnosis Drops!

3
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:07,654
Calling for collaborations!

4
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,408
This is for you, Setsuko.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,910
MARBLE

6
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,412
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,209
Won't leave

8
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:26,923
Without a dropkick on her

9
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,012
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

10
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:48,111
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,613
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

12
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,490
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,202
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

14
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,121
If you go too far

15
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,083
I'll slice you up completely

16
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,460
Your halo
Must get it back

17
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:08,548
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

18
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:12,802
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

19
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,931
I'll never give up

20
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,683
Yurine, you're off your guard!

21
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:22,770
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

22
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:25,690
Huh? What? I missed...

23
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:29,110
Can't leave Earth

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
Without a dropkick on her

25
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:37,410
But until then

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,333
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

27
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:51,049
Please donate to the children in need.

28
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:52,967
Any amount will help!

29
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,969
Would you like to donate?

30
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,847
Finally, a substantial amount of savings.

31
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,726
I can finally rent a place.

32
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,520
All that hard work is about to pay off!

33
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,280
Please donate to the children in need!

34
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:15,990
Any amount will help.

35
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:18,618
Perfect score!

36
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,830
Really?

37
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:27,460
Did it really just make it in
that tiny little hole?

38
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,046
LET'S HELP EACH OTHER OUT
DONATION BOX

39
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:33,758
I'm sorry, it all happened so quickly.

40
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,176
May I get my--?

41
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:38,429
Thank you for your donation!

42
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,266
You're a savior to these kids.

43
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,394
Thank you very much!

44
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,021
It wasn't meant to be a donation.

45
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,690
You are a truly giving soul.

46
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,109
Like an angel!

47
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:53,569
No, you are an angel!

48
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,696
No...

49
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:00,201
You're an angel!

50
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,416
If it'll help the children in need,

51
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,418
I can't ask for anything more.

52
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,420
You're amazing.

53
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,506
Thank you again!

54
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,009
Ready?

55
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:22,056
How could that money fly into a box like that!

56
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,433
I'm such an idiot.

57
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,520
I should've asked them
to give me back my money!

58
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:35,111
Except for this 2000 yen bill,
which I sewed into my underwear,

59
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,738
I lost all my money.

60
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,959
But it will all go to benefit children in need.

61
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:51,669
That's a good thing.

62
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,047
No matter how poor
or bitter my experience,

63
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,632
I'm...

64
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,968
I'm still an angel.

65
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:01,429
I'm still an angel!

66
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,680
I deserve it!

67
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,267
I'll treat myself to Kanda Matsuya's
curry nanban, only 1000 yen,

68
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:07,810
before I head to work!

69
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,152
Oh, hey, Pekola.

70
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,532
Don't just stand there,
come sit next to me.

71
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,619
I'd rather not.

72
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,163
Are there any other seats?

73
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,956
Nope.

74
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,461
You're here to eat, too?

75
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:36,422
Well, duh, why else would I be here?

76
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:40,051
I really didn't want to wear myself out before work.

77
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:42,053
Welcome!

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,679
Curry nanban, please.

79
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,097
Right away!

80
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,559
Their curry nanban's really good.

81
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,357
You know those girls collecting donations
by the train station?

82
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,528
Claiming they're helping children in need.

83
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,821
Turns out, it was a scam.

84
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,449
I'm not surprised.

85
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,577
I just saw them get arrested.

86
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,621
A charity scam.

87
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:09,997
Two girls...

88
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,750
For children in need...

89
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,796
Thank you for your donation!

90
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:23,678
I can't believe people
actually fall for those scams.

91
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,888
Right, Pekola?

92
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,017
Pekola, what's wrong?

93
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,812
Pekola?

94
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,022
Pekola!

95
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,358
Hey!

96
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:43,030
-Here's the curry nanban.
-Sweet, a Shureimon!

97
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,200
This is for the bill.
I'll take the nanban.

98
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,120
I had no money, so that worked out.

99
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,793
-Excuse me, this isn't enough.
-What?

100
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:01,591
Dropkick on my Devil!
will undergo a transformation!

101
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:05,469
Now begins, the legend
of detective Jashin-chan!

102
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:06,637
FIVE SECONDS LATER

103
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,562
W--WATER...

104
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:19,066
I'm so tired of this unbearable heat.

105
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,573
Is Yurine home?

106
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,492
No, she's actually dead.

107
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,746
It's always so freezing cold
with you two around.

108
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,832
YOU KILLED HER, DIDN'T YOU?

109
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,501
BRING YURINE BACK!

110
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,129
Shut up.
There's nothing you can do.

111
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:43,257
Take that!
The Hundred Crack Tail!

112
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:49,930
I just showcased
my new killer technique

113
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,058
on a low-level devil.

114
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,778
You hurt my sister again.

115
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,863
Yurine's gone, too.

116
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,783
I refuse to let you live on like this.

117
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,370
What's all this about?

118
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,748
Hi, Yusa, how are you?

119
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,376
Of course you're alive.

120
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,170
Make yourself at home.

121
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,922
Why, thank you.

122
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:26,676
I have to sacrifice my snack for them!

123
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:29,929
A tiny slice should suffice for Koji.

124
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:39,271
We're here to ask you a favor, Yurine.

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,481
A favor?

126
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:41,982
Yes.

127
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:46,821
Would you please taste test this?

128
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,280
"Hell Ice Cream"?

129
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:51,450
Since business is slow in Hell,

130
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:55,079
we want to start selling ice cream
in the human world.

131
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,123
As a trusted human,

132
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,960
-we want you to taste test our product.
-Cute packaging.

133
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,587
Sure, of course.

134
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,299
I'm surprised that business is slow for you.

135
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,552
You practically have no overhead.

136
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:13,723
It's true, but it's not selling at all in Hell.

137
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:17,893
Perhaps there's no demand
in an icy cold area?

138
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:23,441
You're right.
That never occurred to me.

139
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:26,610
Your sister's kind of slow, huh?

140
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:29,447
Let's give it a taste.

141
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,870
It's delicious.

142
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,038
-What a relief.
-My turn!

143
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,499
What flavor is this?

144
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,543
It's Basilisk venom.

145
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,628
Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:48,090
Organisms die just by walking near the Basilisk!

147
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,303
You're taking a big risk with the Basilisk!

148
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,846
You know that, right?

149
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,308
Well, I don't mind if Yurine dies.

150
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,186
It's all been processed, so it's safe.

151
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,688
Are you sure about that?

152
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,151
How the hell were you able
to get the Basilisk venom?

153
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,611
That's just it.

154
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:14,492
We already spent so much time and money
producing this ice cream.

155
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,869
Based on my calculations,

156
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:20,122
each cup has to sell for 1,000,000 yen.

157
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,540
Think it would sell?

158
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,671
-No way in hell.
-What?

159
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,966
-Did I mention your sister's dumb?
-But, my debts...

160
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,476
Dropkick on My Devil!
will sign with a different company!

161
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:41,477
WIG

162
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,187
We're free agents!

163
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,898
Now we're
Food Wars: Dropkick on My Devil!

164
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:46,941
FIVE SECONDS LATER

165
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:53,823
I want a high-paying day job.

166
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,618
There seems to be a shortage of those.

167
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,790
30,000 yen per day? That sounds good!

168
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:07,670
The terms state that regardless of gender,
the candidate must be strong and healthy.

169
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,130
Even without my angel powers,

170
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,299
I'm still stronger than a human.

171
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,261
This job's for me!

172
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:20,432
But why does the job description say "shield"?

173
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:24,061
I guess I'll give them a call.

174
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:28,858
That must be...

175
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,820
An angel? She doesn't have a halo though.

176
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh, well, still no sight
of Jashin-chan whatsoever.

177
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:40,870
Where could she be...

178
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,831
in this Tokyo desert?

179
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,210
They hired me without hesitation.

180
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:52,548
But, I still have no idea what the job entails.

181
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,969
Though, I'm really lucky
to have found a high-paying job like this.

182
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,096
Today must be my lucky day!

183
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,432
I should shop for a couple things.

184
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:03,309
Hey, new hire!

185
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:08,230
Hey, you're at every one of my jobs.

186
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,316
What? You sound crazy.

187
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:14,361
I'm about to explain the job to you
so listen up, new hire.

188
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:18,157
It's Pekola. I do have a name.

189
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:21,577
He sounds ignorant as always.

190
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:25,080
I don't care if you're Pekola or not.

191
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,959
This guy doesn't even care
to know my name.

192
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,669
You'll be the bodyguard.

193
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,671
Got it? Okay, I'm done here.

194
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,509
-Come in, Noel Amatsuka!
-Guard? That explains "shield."

195
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,720
Good morning!

196
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,722
Your holy idol,

197
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:44,808
Noel is here!

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,103
-Poporon?
-Pekola?

199
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,689
Just standby here, okay?

200
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:52,441
Got it.

201
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,319
Noel Amatsuka?

202
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,321
An alias, of course.

203
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,201
It's easier to get around as a typical girl
who aspires to be an idol.

204
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:05,579
An alias? What a brilliant idea.

205
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,539
But that would make me a liar.

206
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:10,250
You're just too damn naive.

207
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,087
Things are going well for me.

208
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:15,422
Even though I'm just getting started.

209
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:20,803
Why do you need a bodyguard?
Is being an idol that dangerous?

210
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,931
It's just better to be safe than sorry.

211
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:26,767
Someone might attack during an event.

212
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,311
I'm counting on you to protect me.

213
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:30,729
Of course.

214
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,856
I'm getting paid to do that.

215
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,443
Plus, you're going out there
as a working human.

216
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:39,196
I'm not just a responsible worker.

217
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:42,032
As an angel, my duty is to protect humans!

218
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,660
Cut the holier-than-thou act.

219
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:47,246
You always rubbed me the wrong way.

220
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:51,250
I despise all that "angel's duty" talk.

221
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,960
Poporon...

222
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:54,628
It's showtime!

223
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,338
Coming!

224
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,673
HOLY IDOL NOEL AMATSUKA

225
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,342
NOEL

226
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:02,261
Thank you very much.

227
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,722
Your autographed photobook
is gonna be my heirloom!

228
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,140
NOEL AMATSUKA
AUTOGRAPH SESSION

229
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:07,850
What an honor!

230
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,103
Please sign right here.

231
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:12,312
Okay!

232
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:15,649
Please address it to "Noel's pig."

233
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,276
I dreamt about this!

234
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,819
How funny!

235
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,279
What a freak.

236
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:43,761
The sky above me
Is covered in clouds

237
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:47,222
Why can't it be sunny today?

238
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:51,894
It makes it so hard
To get motivated for the day

239
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,229
But you know

240
00:13:54,438 --> 00:14:01,278
It's not all sunshine and rainbows

241
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:08,202
But there's still not enough time to waste
Just moping around

242
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,541
In a restless world
That's ever-changing...

243
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,879
I don't want to be stuck

244
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,882
In a never-ending cycle

245
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:26,637
Of repeating the same mundane routine

246
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,890
I refuse to live such a life

247
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,477
Let's make a miracle happen

248
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,688
And live like the one

249
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:41,110
Whose life is full of excitement

250
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,363
So, are you ready?

251
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,990
I'm coming for you

252
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:49,701
Good.

253
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,871
Seems like everything's under control.

254
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:56,208
What should I treat myself to
for dinner tonight?

255
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,212
The eel special, or a juicy steak?

256
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,256
Curry nanban sounds good, too.

257
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,639
I have a deep grudge against you, Noel!

258
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:14,351
This is what you get
for acting so cold on social media!

259
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:24,111
Pekola, you really protected me!

260
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:26,113
Damn you, Noel!

261
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,949
You ignore all my R-rated questions!

262
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,410
You deserve to die!

263
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,580
What the--?

264
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:39,251
Poporon, don't just stand there, run!

265
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,670
Get off me!

266
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:43,380
Never!

267
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,759
You idiot! You're risking your life
for a mere 30,000 yen!

268
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,220
It's not about the money.

269
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:54,600
Even without powers, I'm an angel.
Protecting humans is my duty!

270
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:59,229
But I'm not human.

271
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:02,733
You're Noel, a human idol.

272
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,444
And you used to serve me as an angel.

273
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,821
I'll protect you no matter what!

274
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,451
Shut up!

275
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,298
Where am I?

276
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,259
You need to take it easy right now.

277
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:31,637
Yurine Hanazono?

278
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:34,223
Where's Poporon?

279
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:36,850
Don't worry, she's safe.

280
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,603
The police arrested that man.

281
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,316
We're here because Yurine found out
through a news feed.

282
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,027
Thank you very much.

283
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,779
We brought bananas, too.

284
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,531
They're not for you to eat, Jashin-chan.

285
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,326
-Don't play with food.
-I can't hear you.

286
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:56,870
You brought this fruit basket for me?

287
00:16:57,162 --> 00:17:00,123
That was there before we arrived.

288
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:01,750
Really?

289
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:07,089
I hope today's pay
covers the medical expenses.

290
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:11,260
The nurse said your bill
was paid for already.

291
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,013
I'm taking the melon in exchange
for peeling the apples.

292
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,099
You glutton.

293
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,060
Who could it be?

294
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,687
HEAVEN HOSPITAL

295
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,150
Pekola, you idiot.

296
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:31,780
Dropkick on my Devil! Yet another transformation!
Now I'm a flight attendant.

297
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,700
Brace yourself for the overhead dropkick!

298
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:35,826
FIVE SECONDS LATER

299
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,001
DAMN IT.

300
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,961
UNHAPPY TURN

301
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,886
Here, Jashin-chan, say "ah."

302
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:58,640
Yum...

303
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,101
Can't beat tangerines in the winter.

304
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,689
Oh, yeah, Jashin-chan.

305
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,816
Teach me how to make chocolate!

306
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,027
Why?

307
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:12,571
It's almost Valentine's Day!

308
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,366
Are you giving it to someone?

309
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,077
Yes!

310
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:26,460
-Who?
-It's a secret.

311
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,420
Then I won't teach you!

312
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,172
Oh, come on!

313
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:33,216
You're a master at making sweets.

314
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,802
Go buy them at the store!

315
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:40,390
Valentine's specials are happening
all over town right now.

316
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:46,646
I know, but I want
to gift my special someone handmade chocolate.

317
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,150
Medusa's "special someone"?

318
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,781
-She actually met someone else?
-Not sure if they'll like it though...

319
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,117
All because I'm stuck in the human world!

320
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:01,161
What's wrong, Jashin-chan?

321
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:07,000
Fine, I'll let you know who it is.
So, teach me, okay?

322
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,753
I'll tell you after we're done.

323
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,839
Okay.

324
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,759
I'll kill the bastard the moment I get back.

325
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,723
This is a bit embarrassing.

326
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:25,227
Proper form is important.

327
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,270
That's a tall hat!

328
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:31,400
Let's be fancy and make our own chocolate mixture
from scratch.

329
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,236
Chop up those chocolate bars.

330
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:35,362
Okay!

331
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:42,411
The way you're cutting is dangerous.

332
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:47,791
Make a paw with your fist
so you don't cut yourself.

333
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,254
-Try it out.
-Okay!

334
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:56,967
You don't want to gift them your fingertips.

335
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:59,469
Got it. Am I doing it right?

336
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,681
Next, we'll pour the fresh cream into the pot

337
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,017
and warm it up on medium heat
without letting it boil.

338
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,980
Add the chopped chocolate and stir.

339
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:16,319
Pour the melted chocolate mixture
on a tray lined with baking paper.

340
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:21,283
Then, let it cool and solidify
in the fridge for an hour.

341
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:26,538
One, two, three, four.

342
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,710
Do you think it's ready now?

343
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,753
It has only been five minutes.

344
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:39,050
So, this person's that important, huh?

345
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:42,471
Yup, they're irreplaceable!

346
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:45,140
They're on the hit list for sure.

347
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:46,850
3579!

348
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:49,603
3599! 3600!

349
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,646
Finally, an hour!

350
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:55,066
Look! The chocolate's ready!

351
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,863
All you have to do is cut it up
and sprinkle cocoa powder on top.

352
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,532
Thank you, Jashin-chan!

353
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,626
There!

354
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:15,670
Jashin-chan?

355
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:17,297
What?

356
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:18,673
Here!

357
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,092
It's a present for you!

358
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,471
I told you it was for a very special person.

359
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,852
I never saw that coming.

360
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:35,941
Let's be friends forever.

361
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,569
Thanks, Medusa!

362
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,740
You had me worried there for a sec!

363
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:46,368
-Really? Why?
-No, it's nothing!

364
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:49,371
Hey, Yurine, how was your day?

365
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,541
Hey, Minos, you must be tired.

366
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:55,293
Not at all, it's all fun for me.

367
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,420
Just glad to be working.

368
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,090
Stop it, Jashin-chan!

369
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:02,509
You stop!

370
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:05,428
They're always so happy together.

371
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,430
Yup!

372
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:34,457
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

373
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:39,379
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

374
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:44,676
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

375
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:49,097
As she starves to death

376
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:51,600
It's a love and hate relationship

377
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,893
Can't leave each other alone

378
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,523
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

379
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:02,777
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

380
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,196
Test my heart, don't stop

381
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:12,287
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

382
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:16,666
We're a happy family

383
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:20,754
Let me say, I love you

384
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,256
When all is said and done

385
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:27,802
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

386
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:32,599
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

387
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:34,809
For another crazy tomorrow

388
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,521
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

389
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:46,071
Devils run, roar, and sing for a girl.

390
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:48,657
There was certainly a bond.

391
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,910
Dropkick on My Devil! To the sky!

392
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,663
Be prepared for the dropkick in the next episode, too!

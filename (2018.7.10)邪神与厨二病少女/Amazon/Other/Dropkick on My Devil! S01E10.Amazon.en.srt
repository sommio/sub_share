1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,253
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,296
Telegnosis Drops!

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,174
Calling for collaborations!

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,887
This is for you, Setsuko.

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,431
MARBLE

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,933
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,688
Won't leave

8
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:26,444
Without a dropkick on her

9
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,533
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

10
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,590
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

11
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,134
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

12
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,011
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,600
If you go too far

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,604
I'll slice you up completely

16
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,981
Your halo
Must get it back

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,027
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

18
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,323
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,452
I'll never give up

20
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,204
Yurine, you're off your guard!

21
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,291
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

22
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,211
Huh? What? I missed...

23
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,631
Can't leave Earth

24
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,719
Without a dropkick on her

25
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,931
But until then

26
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:42,853
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

27
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,528
Please donate to the children in need.

28
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,446
Any amount will help!

29
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,448
Would you like to donate?

30
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,326
Finally, a substantial amount of savings.

31
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,205
I can finally rent a place.

32
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,041
All that hard work is about to pay off!

33
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,801
Please donate to the children in need!

34
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,511
Any amount will help.

35
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,097
Perfect score!

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,351
Really?

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,939
Did it really just make it in
that tiny little hole?

38
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,525
LET'S HELP EACH OTHER OUT
DONATION BOX

39
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:33,237
I'm sorry, it all happened so quickly.

40
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,655
May I get my--?

41
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,908
Thank you for your donation!

42
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,745
You're a savior to these kids.

43
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,914
Thank you very much!

44
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,542
It wasn't meant to be a donation.

45
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,211
You are a truly giving soul.

46
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,588
Like an angel!

47
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,048
No, you are an angel!

48
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,175
No...

49
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,680
You're an angel!

50
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,895
If it'll help the children in need,

51
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,897
I can't ask for anything more.

52
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,940
You're amazing.

53
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,985
Thank you again!

54
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,530
Ready?

55
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,535
How could that money fly into a box like that!

56
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,953
I'm such an idiot.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,999
I should've asked them
to give me back my money!

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,632
Except for this 2000 yen bill,
which I sewed into my underwear,

59
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,217
I lost all my money.

60
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:49,438
But it will all go to benefit children in need.

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,148
That's a good thing.

62
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,526
No matter how poor
or bitter my experience,

63
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,153
I'm...

64
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,447
I'm still an angel.

65
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,908
I'm still an angel!

66
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,159
I deserve it!

67
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,746
I'll treat myself to Kanda Matsuya's
curry nanban, only 1000 yen,

68
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,331
before I head to work!

69
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,673
Oh, hey, Pekola.

70
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,053
Don't just stand there,
come sit next to me.

71
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,098
I'd rather not.

72
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,684
Are there any other seats?

73
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,435
Nope.

74
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,982
You're here to eat, too?

75
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,943
Well, duh, why else would I be here?

76
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,571
I really didn't want to wear myself out before work.

77
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,573
Welcome!

78
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,200
Curry nanban, please.

79
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,576
Right away!

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,038
Their curry nanban's really good.

81
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,836
You know those girls collecting donations
by the train station?

82
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,007
Claiming they're helping children in need.

83
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,342
Turns out, it was a scam.

84
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,928
I'm not surprised.

85
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,056
I just saw them get arrested.

86
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,100
A charity scam.

87
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,476
Two girls...

88
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,229
For children in need...

89
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,275
Thank you for your donation!

90
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,157
I can't believe people
actually fall for those scams.

91
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,367
Right, Pekola?

92
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,496
Pekola, what's wrong?

93
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,332
Pekola?

94
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,543
Pekola!

95
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,837
Hey!

96
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,509
-Here's the curry nanban.
-Sweet, a Shureimon!

97
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,721
This is for the bill.
I'll take the nanban.

98
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,640
I had no money, so that worked out.

99
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,314
-Excuse me, this isn't enough.
-What?

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,070
Dropkick on my Devil!
will undergo a transformation!

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,990
Now begins, the legend
of detective Jashin-chan!

102
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,116
FIVE SECONDS LATER

103
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,083
W--WATER...

104
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,545
I'm so tired of this unbearable heat.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,094
Is Yurine home?

106
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,013
No, she's actually dead.

107
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,225
It's always so freezing cold
with you two around.

108
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,353
YOU KILLED HER, DIDN'T YOU?

109
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,022
BRING YURINE BACK!

110
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,608
Shut up.
There's nothing you can do.

111
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,736
Take that!
The Hundred Crack Tail!

112
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,451
I just showcased
my new killer technique

113
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,537
on a low-level devil.

114
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,257
You hurt my sister again.

115
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,384
Yurine's gone, too.

116
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,303
I refuse to let you live on like this.

117
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,849
What's all this about?

118
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,227
Hi, Yusa, how are you?

119
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,855
Of course you're alive.

120
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,649
Make yourself at home.

121
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,442
Why, thank you.

122
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,155
I have to sacrifice my snack for them!

123
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,408
A tiny slice should suffice for Koji.

124
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,792
We're here to ask you a favor, Yurine.

125
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,002
A favor?

126
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,503
Yes.

127
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,300
Would you please taste test this?

128
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,801
"Hell Ice Cream"?

129
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,929
Since business is slow in Hell,

130
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,558
we want to start selling ice cream
in the human world.

131
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,643
As a trusted human,

132
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,480
-we want you to taste test our product.
-Cute packaging.

133
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,066
Sure, of course.

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm surprised that business is slow for you.

135
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,072
You practically have no overhead.

136
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:13,243
It's true, but it's not selling at all in Hell.

137
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,414
Perhaps there's no demand
in an icy cold area?

138
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,961
You're right.
That never occurred to me.

139
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,089
Your sister's kind of slow, huh?

140
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,926
Let's give it a taste.

141
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,349
It's delicious.

142
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,517
-What a relief.
-My turn!

143
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,978
What flavor is this?

144
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,064
It's Basilisk venom.

145
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,107
Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,611
Organisms die just by walking near the Basilisk!

147
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,823
You're taking a big risk with the Basilisk!

148
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,325
You know that, right?

149
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,787
Well, I don't mind if Yurine dies.

150
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,665
It's all been processed, so it's safe.

151
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,167
Are you sure about that?

152
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,630
How the hell were you able
to get the Basilisk venom?

153
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,090
That's just it.

154
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:14,012
We already spent so much time and money
producing this ice cream.

155
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,348
Based on my calculations,

156
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,643
each cup has to sell for 1,000,000 yen.

157
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,019
Think it would sell?

158
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,192
-No way in hell.
-What?

159
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,445
-Did I mention your sister's dumb?
-But, my debts...

160
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,955
Dropkick on My Devil!
will sign with a different company!

161
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:40,956
WIG

162
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,666
We're free agents!

163
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,377
Now we're
Food Wars: Dropkick on My Devil!

164
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,461
FIVE SECONDS LATER

165
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,343
I want a high-paying day job.

166
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,097
There seems to be a shortage of those.

167
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,311
30,000 yen per day? That sounds good!

168
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:07,190
The terms state that regardless of gender,
the candidate must be strong and healthy.

169
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,651
Even without my angel powers,

170
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm still stronger than a human.

171
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,781
This job's for me!

172
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,953
But why does the job description say "shield"?

173
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,582
I guess I'll give them a call.

174
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,337
That must be...

175
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,341
An angel? She doesn't have a halo though.

176
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,679
Oh, well, still no sight
of Jashin-chan whatsoever.

177
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,349
Where could she be...

178
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,310
in this Tokyo desert?

179
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,731
They hired me without hesitation.

180
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:52,027
But, I still have no idea what the job entails.

181
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,448
Though, I'm really lucky
to have found a high-paying job like this.

182
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,575
Today must be my lucky day!

183
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,952
I should shop for a couple things.

184
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,788
Hey, new hire!

185
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,709
Hey, you're at every one of my jobs.

186
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,795
What? You sound crazy.

187
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,882
I'm about to explain the job to you
so listen up, new hire.

188
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,636
It's Pekola. I do have a name.

189
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,056
He sounds ignorant as always.

190
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,559
I don't care if you're Pekola or not.

191
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,438
This guy doesn't even care
to know my name.

192
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,148
You'll be the bodyguard.

193
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,192
Got it? Okay, I'm done here.

194
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,988
-Come in, Noel Amatsuka!
-Guard? That explains "shield."

195
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,241
Good morning!

196
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,243
Your holy idol,

197
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,287
Noel is here!

198
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,624
-Poporon?
-Pekola?

199
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,168
Just standby here, okay?

200
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,962
Got it.

201
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,798
Noel Amatsuka?

202
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,800
An alias, of course.

203
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,680
It's easier to get around as a typical girl
who aspires to be an idol.

204
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,058
An alias? What a brilliant idea.

205
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,060
But that would make me a liar.

206
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,771
You're just too damn naive.

207
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,566
Things are going well for me.

208
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,943
Even though I'm just getting started.

209
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,323
Why do you need a bodyguard?
Is being an idol that dangerous?

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,452
It's just better to be safe than sorry.

211
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,246
Someone might attack during an event.

212
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,832
I'm counting on you to protect me.

213
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,208
Of course.

214
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,335
I'm getting paid to do that.

215
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,964
Plus, you're going out there
as a working human.

216
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,675
I'm not just a responsible worker.

217
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,553
As an angel, my duty is to protect humans!

218
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,139
Cut the holier-than-thou act.

219
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,725
You always rubbed me the wrong way.

220
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,729
I despise all that "angel's duty" talk.

221
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,481
Poporon...

222
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,107
It's showtime!

223
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,817
Coming!

224
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,194
HOLY IDOL NOEL AMATSUKA

225
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,863
NOEL

226
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,740
Thank you very much.

227
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,242
Your autographed photobook
is gonna be my heirloom!

228
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,660
NOEL AMATSUKA
AUTOGRAPH SESSION

229
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,370
What an honor!

230
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,624
Please sign right here.

231
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,833
Okay!

232
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,128
Please address it to "Noel's pig."

233
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,755
I dreamt about this!

234
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,298
How funny!

235
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,758
What a freak.

236
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,240
The sky above me
Is covered in clouds

237
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,743
Why can't it be sunny today?

238
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,414
It makes it so hard
To get motivated for the day

239
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,750
But you know

240
00:13:53,917 --> 00:14:00,757
It's not all sunshine and rainbows

241
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:07,722
But there's still not enough time to waste
Just moping around

242
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:14,062
In a restless world
That's ever-changing...

243
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,358
I don't want to be stuck

244
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,403
In a never-ending cycle

245
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,116
Of repeating the same mundane routine

246
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,411
I refuse to live such a life

247
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,956
Let's make a miracle happen

248
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,167
And live like the one

249
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,589
Whose life is full of excitement

250
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,883
So, are you ready?

251
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,469
I'm coming for you

252
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,222
Good.

253
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,392
Seems like everything's under control.

254
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,687
What should I treat myself to
for dinner tonight?

255
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,733
The eel special, or a juicy steak?

256
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,735
Curry nanban sounds good, too.

257
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,118
I have a deep grudge against you, Noel!

258
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,872
This is what you get
for acting so cold on social media!

259
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,632
Pekola, you really protected me!

260
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,634
Damn you, Noel!

261
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,428
You ignore all my R-rated questions!

262
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,889
You deserve to die!

263
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,059
What the--?

264
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,772
Poporon, don't just stand there, run!

265
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,149
Get off me!

266
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,901
Never!

267
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:47,280
You idiot! You're risking your life
for a mere 30,000 yen!

268
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,699
It's not about the money.

269
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,079
Even without powers, I'm an angel.
Protecting humans is my duty!

270
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,708
But I'm not human.

271
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,253
You're Noel, a human idol.

272
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,964
And you used to serve me as an angel.

273
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,342
I'll protect you no matter what!

274
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,930
Shut up!

275
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,777
Where am I?

276
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,738
You need to take it easy right now.

277
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,116
Yurine Hanazono?

278
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,743
Where's Poporon?

279
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,329
Don't worry, she's safe.

280
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,124
The police arrested that man.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,795
We're here because Yurine found out
through a news feed.

282
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,506
Thank you very much.

283
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,258
We brought bananas, too.

284
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,052
They're not for you to eat, Jashin-chan.

285
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,805
-Don't play with food.
-I can't hear you.

286
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,391
You brought this fruit basket for me?

287
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,644
That was there before we arrived.

288
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,229
Really?

289
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,568
I hope today's pay
covers the medical expenses.

290
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,780
The nurse said your bill
was paid for already.

291
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,534
I'm taking the melon in exchange
for peeling the apples.

292
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,578
You glutton.

293
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,581
Who could it be?

294
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,166
HEAVEN HOSPITAL

295
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,671
Pekola, you idiot.

296
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,259
Dropkick on my Devil! Yet another transformation!
Now I'm a flight attendant.

297
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,179
Brace yourself for the overhead dropkick!

298
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,305
FIVE SECONDS LATER

299
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,480
DAMN IT.

300
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,482
UNHAPPY TURN

301
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,365
Here, Jashin-chan, say "ah."

302
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,161
Yum...

303
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,580
Can't beat tangerines in the winter.

304
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,168
Oh, yeah, Jashin-chan.

305
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,295
Teach me how to make chocolate!

306
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,506
Why?

307
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,091
It's almost Valentine's Day!

308
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,845
Are you giving it to someone?

309
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,556
Yes!

310
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,939
-Who?
-It's a secret.

311
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,899
Then I won't teach you!

312
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,692
Oh, come on!

313
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,695
You're a master at making sweets.

314
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,323
Go buy them at the store!

315
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,869
Valentine's specials are happening
all over town right now.

316
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:46,125
I know, but I want
to gift my special someone handmade chocolate.

317
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,671
Medusa's "special someone"?

318
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:55,301
-She actually met someone else?
-Not sure if they'll like it though...

319
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,596
All because I'm stuck in the human world!

320
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,640
What's wrong, Jashin-chan?

321
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:06,479
Fine, I'll let you know who it is.
So, teach me, okay?

322
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,274
I'll tell you after we're done.

323
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,360
Okay.

324
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,238
I'll kill the bastard the moment I get back.

325
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,244
This is a bit embarrassing.

326
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,706
Proper form is important.

327
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,791
That's a tall hat!

328
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,920
Let's be fancy and make our own chocolate mixture
from scratch.

329
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,715
Chop up those chocolate bars.

330
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,883
Okay!

331
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,931
The way you're cutting is dangerous.

332
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,270
Make a paw with your fist
so you don't cut yourself.

333
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,774
-Try it out.
-Okay!

334
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,446
You don't want to gift them your fingertips.

335
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,948
Got it. Am I doing it right?

336
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,201
Next, we'll pour the fresh cream into the pot

337
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,496
and warm it up on medium heat
without letting it boil.

338
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,459
Add the chopped chocolate and stir.

339
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,840
Pour the melted chocolate mixture
on a tray lined with baking paper.

340
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,803
Then, let it cool and solidify
in the fridge for an hour.

341
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,017
One, two, three, four.

342
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,189
Do you think it's ready now?

343
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,274
It has only been five minutes.

344
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,571
So, this person's that important, huh?

345
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,991
Yup, they're irreplaceable!

346
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,619
They're on the hit list for sure.

347
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,371
3579!

348
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,123
3599! 3600!

349
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,125
Finally, an hour!

350
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,545
Look! The chocolate's ready!

351
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:59,384
All you have to do is cut it up
and sprinkle cocoa powder on top.

352
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,053
Thank you, Jashin-chan!

353
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,105
There!

354
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,149
Jashin-chan?

355
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,776
What?

356
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,194
Here!

357
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,613
It's a present for you!

358
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,992
I told you it was for a very special person.

359
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,373
I never saw that coming.

360
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,461
Let's be friends forever.

361
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,048
Thanks, Medusa!

362
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,261
You had me worried there for a sec!

363
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,847
-Really? Why?
-No, it's nothing!

364
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,850
Hey, Yurine, how was your day?

365
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,020
Hey, Minos, you must be tired.

366
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,814
Not at all, it's all fun for me.

367
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,941
Just glad to be working.

368
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,569
Stop it, Jashin-chan!

369
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:01,988
You stop!

370
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,907
They're always so happy together.

371
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,951
Yup!

372
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,936
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

373
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,858
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

374
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,155
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

375
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:48,576
As she starves to death

376
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,120
It's a love and hate relationship

377
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,414
Can't leave each other alone

378
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:58,044
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

379
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:02,256
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

380
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,675
Test my heart, don't stop

381
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:11,766
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

382
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:16,145
We're a happy family

383
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:20,274
Let me say, I love you

384
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,735
When all is said and done

385
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:27,323
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

386
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:32,078
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

387
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,330
For another crazy tomorrow

388
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,042
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

389
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:45,591
Devils run, roar, and sing for a girl.

390
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,136
There was certainly a bond.

391
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,430
Dropkick on My Devil! To the sky!

392
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,183
Be prepared for the dropkick in the next episode, too!

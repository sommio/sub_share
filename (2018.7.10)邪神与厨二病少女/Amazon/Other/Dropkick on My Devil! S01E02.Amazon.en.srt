1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,588
Won’t leave

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,386
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:16,517
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
I gotta kill her or else
What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
I can’t go back to Hell!
Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,584
If you go too far,

9
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,588
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,969
Never miss a chance
Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,182
To attack her from behind!
You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,436
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,062
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed…

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,703
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,873
But until then,

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
let’s all have fun together!
Yeah!

21
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:51,028
I'm dying!
The "summer" is too hot.

22
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,198
-Endure it.
-No can do.

23
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,955
-Endure--
-No can do!

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,835
-We are aliens and we come in peace.
-You're a devil.

25
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:11,090
Why don't you have one of those
wind machines in here?

26
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:15,386
An air conditioner?
We can't afford that.

27
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,431
I bet I could get Medusa
to buy us one.

28
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,686
Don't bother.
Just live with the fan.

29
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,772
This lukewarm air
is not gonna cut it!

30
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:39,368
We would have an air conditioner
if we weren't with Flex Comix.

31
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,619
Huh?

32
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,290
The bigger publishers
take good care of their talents.

33
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,131
I'm totally lost!

34
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,176
I'm out! Gonna go cool down
at an electronics shop in Akiba.

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,861
This...

36
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,571
is hell...

37
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,952
It's so hot!

38
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,954
And humid on top of that!

39
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,041
Discomfort index is 100,
no, more like 2020!

40
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,336
I can't believe they're hosting
the Olympics here.

41
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,587
It's such a scam.

42
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,841
"Omotenashi," my ass!

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,470
What's with the dissing?
You're gonna get roasted for that.

44
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,016
Shut up. I'll just give up, then.

45
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,937
Fine, I'll make it cooler for you.

46
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,939
Really?

47
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,826
W-What's this?

48
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,497
A punishment.
It's also much cooler now, right?

49
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,208
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

50
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,421
It's cooler all right...
It's freezing.

51
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:20,427
It's freezing... I'm so cold...

52
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,139
Well, that's good isn't it, Jashin-chan?

53
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,479
I won't stand for this!

54
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,984
Yurine, you're out of your mind.

55
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,361
Then don't act like a brat.

56
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,115
If it's come to this,
I better summon "it" from hell.

57
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:42,825
"It"?

58
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,749
Who is this?

59
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,377
Kori-chan, an Ice Devil.

60
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,379
Kori-chan?

61
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,382
Funny-looking face.

62
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,177
Kori-chan can cool a room
just by being there.

63
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,390
-Whoa, it really is cooler in here.
-And check this out!

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,355
Instant shaved ice.

65
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,773
Impressive.

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,900
So, which flavor?

67
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,110
Which?

68
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,030
Strawberry or lemon?

69
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,407
Then lemon--

70
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,659
Kori-chan's blood
is strawberry

71
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,912
-and her urine is lemon flavor!
-I'll take strawberry.

72
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,756
It really is strawberry syrup.

73
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,887
I eat hot foods in the summer
to intensify the heat!

74
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,015
Ah! It burns!

75
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,523
A cool room and shaved ice.
So convenient.

76
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,067
Very much so.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,861
But it doesn't just end there.

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,572
Kori-chan, do that thing you do.

79
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,953
You don't want to right now?

80
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,207
Who do you think you are?

81
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,002
A low-class devil like you
must obey me.

82
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,464
Just do what I asked. Now!

83
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,218
Easy there, Jashin-chan.

84
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,227
-Snow...?
-Are you impressed or what?

85
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,107
Low-class devils only exist
to entertain us!

86
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,153
You must be honored
to serve a high-class devil like me.

87
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,995
The snow's getting heavy.

88
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,332
Kori-chan, you can stop now.

89
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,626
That's enough!

90
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,589
Stop right now, damn it!

91
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:07,803
Don't push your luck.
I'm done with you, so go home!

92
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,765
Jashin-chan, watch your mouth.
You're being cruel.

93
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,517
I am not!

94
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,478
This is what you get
for disobeying me!

95
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,022
Jashin-chan Cho--!

96
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,110
Let me explain.

97
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,573
Jashin-chan is relentless to smaller
and weaker low-class devils.

98
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,782
Chop!

99
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,953
Let go.

100
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,582
You froze me.

101
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,962
You stupid brat!

102
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,301
I’m glad you were able to cool off.

103
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,435
Can she regenerate?

104
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,064
How humiliating.

105
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,399
You deserved it.

106
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,484
WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED
"JASHIN-CHAN"

107
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,988
SUZURAN SHOPPING DISTRICT

108
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,255
I'm s-starving.

109
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,093
Angels are immortal, but...

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,931
humans are heartless.

111
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,184
It's obvious that I'm not okay.

112
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,148
My Lord.

113
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,568
Humans are completely corrupt now.

114
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,946
Final judgment day

115
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,490
might be coming in the near future.

116
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,838
An a-angel?

117
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,801
Pekola, are you okay?

118
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,011
The witch...

119
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,019
Enter Bondy from the back
of Kanda Used Bookstore.

120
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,563
Never enter from the bookstore.

121
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,235
The potato's tasty.

122
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,697
But, why do they serve potatoes
at a curry shop?

123
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,574
Eat or talk, just choose one.

124
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,744
Why do they serve potatoes?

125
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,371
Who knows?

126
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,083
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,968
Dig in, curry's best
when it's still hot.

128
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,511
Thank you.

129
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,265
Delicious.

130
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,563
May I have another serving?

131
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,108
Sure, I'll take it from
Jashin-chan's food budget.

132
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,776
One more, please!

133
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,486
Right away.

134
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,532
It's not angel-like of you
to wander around starving.

135
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,867
It's very human.

136
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,707
Without my halo,

137
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,752
I'm no different
than a feeble human.

138
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,254
With my halo,
I can work miracles.

139
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,633
Transforming rock into bread,
water into wine.

140
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,765
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.

141
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,771
Do you know if Jashin-chan
lives around here?

142
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,272
Jashin-chan?

143
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,734
I was sent by my mother from hell

144
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,529
to search for Jashin-chan.

145
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,740
JINBOCHO POLICE

146
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,202
Why don't you stay with us
for about three days?

147
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,621
Yeah, you're suspicious.

148
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,290
-But, Jashin-chan--
-Sure, sure.

149
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,043
Did you eat enough?

150
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,462
Yup, thank you so--

151
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,386
Thanking a witch
means I'm betraying God!

152
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,181
But, she treated me
and I even got seconds!

153
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,018
-I've been sinning all this time!
-May I have another serving?

154
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,062
You talk to yourself too much.

155
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,941
But it's true,
the witch saved my life.

156
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,443
Yurine Hanazono.

157
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,946
I've no choice but to thank you.

158
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:41,243
But, I still haven't given up
on eliminating you and the devils.

159
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:46,039
Just wait. When I find my halo,
and get my powers back,

160
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,125
I'll eliminate you all!

161
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,382
I hope you find your halo soon.

162
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,219
Idiot, weren't you listening
to what I just said?

163
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,848
I get so confused when I'm with you.
I'm going home!

164
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,268
Bless her heart.

165
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,938
My Lord, what should I do?

166
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,774
Should I consider her my neighbor,

167
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,651
even though she’s a witch?

168
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,238
This world is full
of contradictions!

169
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,121
My Lord,
why did they serve potatoes?

170
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,334
Jashin-chan?

171
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,461
100% BEEF

172
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,171
We're here!

173
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,631
Jashin-chan?

174
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,718
She invited us
and she's not even here.

175
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,553
Maybe...

176
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,971
She's in here.

177
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,682
Nope.

178
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,727
I usually find her hiding
in here.

179
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,439
I'm right here!

180
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,567
Trumped you there!

181
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,319
Medusa's like,

182
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,071
"I usually find her hiding
in here."

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,198
Dumbass!

184
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,243
Why would I hide in the same place
over and over again? Idiot.

185
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,455
I-I'll check under the floors
next time.

186
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,166
But, why were you hiding at all?

187
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,169
Good question! Let me tell you...

188
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,549
I know! You were testing to see
if it was a good place to hide

189
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,595
for when you go for
a surprise attack on Yurine!

190
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,555
Oh?

191
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,308
How'd you know?

192
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,978
Save yourself the effort.
You'll fail again.

193
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,314
-Hey, Minos.
-Yeah?

194
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,108
Convince her to give up
on killing Yurine.

195
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,819
No! I'll never give up!

196
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,198
Off you go. The experiment's over.

197
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,616
Out you go.

198
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,789
Any minute now...

199
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,377
I'm back.

200
00:13:55,794 --> 00:14:00,632
I'm hungry. The trident was on sale
today for half off so I bought it.

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,927
-Looks like she's not even here.
-What? A trident?

202
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,262
There!

203
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,266
That's a good place
to store it for now.

204
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,686
Why would you stab
a trident through the floor?

205
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,357
She seems clueless.

206
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,150
But who knows.

207
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,195
She might already know
I'm in here.

208
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,407
Let me check.

209
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,289
All right. She really doesn't know.

210
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,625
I'll throw this at her
just for fun.

211
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,335
Ouch.

212
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,132
An avocado...?

213
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,717
I'll eat it later.

214
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,468
She's clueless!

215
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,138
She's gonna eat it later?
What an idiot.

216
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,142
At this rate,
I could probably go for it...

217
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,146
I'll sneak up behind her
and use this.

218
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,523
This is the end.

219
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,442
Goodbye, Yurine!

220
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,073
YURINE

221
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,631
H-Hey there.

222
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,552
I see what's going on.

223
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,600
I didn't expect to be able to test out
the trident so soon.

224
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,437
T-Trident happy?

225
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,780
Let's "try."

226
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,158
Well, I knew that was coming.

227
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,744
I did my part, I warned her.

228
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:00,960
What is that?

229
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,506
A tomahawk, it was 80 percent off
at the weapon shop.

230
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,687
Hello, Jashin-chan?

231
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,897
Medusa? Come here now!

232
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,400
-W-Why?
-I'll tell you later!

233
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,902
Jashin-chan?

234
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,196
Excuse me!

235
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,156
Your voice is adorable!

236
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,409
You sound exactly like Miyutan!

237
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,285
What's with this bag?

238
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,995
N-No! Not my face!

239
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,748
Don't worry! With a cute voice
like yours,

240
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,293
you'll look cute
even if you're not all that!

241
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,930
That's why I told you to stop.

242
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,517
I gotta get to Jashin-chan now!

243
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,771
Here you go.

244
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,690
Thank you.

245
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,025
Tokyo's a dense city.

246
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,070
I wouldn't worry about
fossilizing one guy.

247
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,367
Anyway, why isn't she here
when she invited you?

248
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,703
Jashin-chan has no respect.

249
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,038
I'm pretty used to it.

250
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,333
Delicious.

251
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,169
What do you mean?

252
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,713
Does she always treat
you this bad?

253
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,216
What? Oh no, not really.

254
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,429
Really?
So, was she always like this?

255
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,724
Well, let's see...

256
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,894
When we attended Hell Elementary...

257
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,688
Jashin-chan acted out

258
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,691
and knocked down a statue
in the courtyard.

259
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,153
Who broke the gargoyle statue?

260
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,490
She hasn't changed a bit.

261
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,661
But, when Jashin-chan was bullying
a weak devil...

262
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,582
Dumb goblin, you can't
score higher than me!

263
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,042
Stop it, Jashin-chan!

264
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,294
You're dumb and stupid!

265
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,839
What did my son do to you?

266
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,967
I said no, but Medusa forced me!

267
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,219
No, I didn't!

268
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,304
Good times.

269
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,472
What part?

270
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,893
Oh, yeah, when she fell in a trap...

271
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,480
All right.

272
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,485
-See ya!
-Wait! Don't leave me in here!

273
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,197
They finally found me
after three days.

274
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,657
Another time...

275
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,411
-Do anything to her but let me go.
-No!

276
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,705
Those were the days.

277
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,041
-Another time!
-Enough.

278
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,085
You've gone through too much.

279
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,586
Really?

280
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,255
I guess as devils,

281
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,508
it doesn't matter if you're mean
and cunning.

282
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,344
Hey there! I'm a meanie!

283
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,515
Why are you still her friend
even though she betrays you all the time?

284
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,475
Are you an "M"?

285
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,232
In any case, Jashin-chan's
still trash.

286
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,277
Actually, she can be pretty cute
at times.

287
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,989
Whenever she's in trouble,

288
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,908
she relies on me the most!

289
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,162
UNDERWORLD

290
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,917
It's just a devilish perspective!

291
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,127
Damn it!

292
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,632
Medusa!

293
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,094
Wait for me!

294
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,680
Don't abandon me!

295
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,350
You're the only one
I could count on!

296
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,146
Forgive me for everything
I've done to you.

297
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,234
I know you like me, Medusa!

298
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,286
When I see her so vulnerable...

299
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,247
She makes me think

300
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,793
she can't live without me,
that I need to be there for her.

301
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:19,177
Careful, don't let any losers
take advantage of you.

302
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,305
O-Okay, I'll be careful.

303
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,432
I'm back!

304
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,808
She's home.

305
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,604
Don't go out when you invite
Medusa over.

306
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,230
She doesn't mind.

307
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,151
Medusa's lower in class
so I make her wait.

308
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,947
Welcome back, Jashin-chan.
Why did you call me?

309
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,823
This is all the money I have.

310
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,075
10,000 YEN

311
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,828
-Idiot! Not in front of Yurine.
-S-Sorry.

312
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,207
I never asked you for money.

313
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,419
But, if you say so,
I'll happily accept the cash.

314
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,339
Then what did you want me for?

315
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,634
If it's illegal in hell,

316
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,511
I can't help you.

317
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,098
We'll handle that later.
I called you for this today.

318
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,726
I won you this at an arcade
in Ikebukuro.

319
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,938
You said it was cute last time.

320
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,900
The panda human doll.

321
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,862
Jashin-chan, you remembered!

322
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,825
I won it using your money, Medusa.

323
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,159
Here you go.

324
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,872
Thanks so much, Jashin-chan!

325
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,754
Don't hug me!
Who do you think you are?

326
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,883
I only did it
because it benefits me.

327
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,720
It means nothing more than that.

328
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,306
But, I'm still happy!

329
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,892
Stop it! Don't hug me!

330
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,606
It looks like a happy ending.

331
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,400
But, it's all doomed.

332
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,444
This looks familiar.

333
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,154
Medusa!

334
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,490
I've seen this before.

335
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,978
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

336
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:38,733
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

337
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:44,072
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

338
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,159
As she starves to death!

339
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,120
It’s a love and hate relationship,

340
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,456
can’t leave each other alone

341
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:58,127
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

342
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:02,340
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

343
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,592
Test my heart, don’t stop

344
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:11,808
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

345
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,062
We’re a happy family La la la

346
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,316
Let me say, I love you!!

347
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,652
When all is said and done

348
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,448
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

349
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:32,161
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

350
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,372
For another crazy tomorrow

351
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,959
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

352
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,257
Winter has come.
The streets are filled with Christmas spirit.

353
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,928
Away from the bustle of the city,
a poor girl cries.

354
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,183
Dropkick on My Devil!
We'll camel clutch your heart in the next episode too!

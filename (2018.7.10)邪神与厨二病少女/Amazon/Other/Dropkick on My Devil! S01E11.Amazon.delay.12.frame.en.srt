1
00:00:01,522 --> 00:00:05,151
Won't leave

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,823
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:17,038
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,011
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,597
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:36,432
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:40,186
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,021
If you go too far

9
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:46,067
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,403
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,490
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,786
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:00,873
I'll never give up

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:06,713
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,632
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:13,052
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:18,141
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,311
But until then

20
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:27,317
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,407
Take this, Yurine!

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,289
Here's my grand entrance dropkick
to start off the final episode!

23
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:44,250
Even though
you'll probably dodge it.

24
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:51,549
I got her...

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,011
That hurt.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,056
An eye for an eye.

27
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,020
I missed.

28
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,856
Oh, well, I forgive you.

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,817
Just get dinner ready, okay?

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,113
She never misses...

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,659
Tonight's dinner
is twice-cooked pork!

32
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:22,580
The cabbage and pork belly
were a steal today.

33
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,958
Delicious!

34
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:29,128
You like twice-cooked pork, right?

35
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:31,839
Yurine?

36
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,510
Yeah, I do.

37
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:38,721
You make it really good too.

38
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,850
But it seems like your appetite
is shot.

39
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:45,186
I'm already full.

40
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm gonna go lie down for a bit.

41
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,113
She left so much.

42
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:57,782
Was it the cheap pork belly?

43
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:02,620
That can't be. I prepared it
so you couldn't even tell.

44
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,330
Yup, it's delicious.

45
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:08,376
Something's wrong.
Yurine never leaves leftovers.

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,839
Yurine, are you okay?

47
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,882
Do you have a fever?

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,009
You're burning up!

49
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,971
Where's the thermometer?

50
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,976
102 degrees?

51
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:28,271
Isn't that really high for humans?

52
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,940
Blankets! Blankets!

53
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:33,860
Lie down here.
Oh, yeah, water-filled pillows!

54
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,530
Put it under your head!

55
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:39,782
Time to change into pajamas!

56
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:45,246
Now we need medicine
to lower her fever...

57
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,583
Which, we don't have.

58
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,960
This should help for now.

59
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,921
Good, now she's rested.

60
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,090
What the hell am I doing?

61
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,552
Why am I taking care of her?

62
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:04,891
She's the very reason
I can't go back to Hell.

63
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,610
She summoned me without knowing
the return spell.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,780
In order for me to return,
she has to die.

65
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:22,992
I'm an idiot.

66
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:27,830
This is my prime opportunity
to kill her while she's weak!

67
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:29,123
Jashin-chan...

68
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,168
Water...

69
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,086
Not my problem.

70
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,631
Go get it yourself.

71
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,181
She's halfway there.
I might as well leave her to die.

72
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,100
Finally!

73
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,354
My long struggle
is about to come to an end!

74
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:55,191
Now, why don't I go celebrate
before my victorious return?

75
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,737
Didn't even need to end
her life myself.

76
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,322
Good-bye Yurine.

77
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:04,700
Living in the human world
wasn't all that bad.

78
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,000
I finally get to go home!

79
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,628
I'll be at the arcade until closing

80
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:18,881
and eat my last curry
on the way back.

81
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,592
Yurine will have to be dead by then!

82
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,141
We'll...

83
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:33,020
never meet again...

84
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,404
I'm cold...

85
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,447
What do you guys think?

86
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,158
She looks miserable,
her fever's too high.

87
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:48,160
She needs to see a doctor now.

88
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,621
Yeah, I'll go get the car.

89
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,873
Jashin-chan, carry her down.

90
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,750
You bet!

91
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,836
Medusa, you get the bill!

92
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,171
Beth, you just stay home!

93
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,551
-By car, did you mean this?
-Yeah!

94
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:06,971
Trust me, this is the best way
to get around

95
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:09,140
Jinbocho's narrow streets.

96
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh, okay.

97
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,477
Hold on tight!

98
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:20,192
Obey the speed limit, Minos!

99
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:24,238
Go, go, go!

100
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:26,490
She took her meds.

101
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,783
She'll recover now.

102
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:31,287
The doctor said
she'll be better in a couple days.

103
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:33,331
What a relief.

104
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:37,168
Never expected you'd save Yurine,
Jashin-chan.

105
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:39,420
See? I told you.

106
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,881
Jashin-chan's generous at heart.

107
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:45,509
Shut up! I'm the devil,
I'll knock you out!

108
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,932
If something happened to Yurine
because of my neglect,

109
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:55,353
you guys would've shunned me.

110
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,522
I do want to go home.

111
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,232
But...

112
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,778
I don't want to lose
you guys either.

113
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,074
Yeah, right.

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,910
You were genuinely concerned
for Yurine.

115
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:14,163
One more word
and I'll turn you into steak!

116
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:17,249
You better not get all cocky either,
Medusa.

117
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,462
-All I want is your money, not you!
-Sure, sure.

118
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,381
Damn it, you better listen!

119
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:27,760
Hey, quiet down.
You're gonna wake Yurine.

120
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,346
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

121
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:35,101
We're out of here.
Take good care of her, okay?

122
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:37,478
Thanks for your help.

123
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:43,943
Now...

124
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:50,282
Let's practice good bedside manners.

125
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:54,203
I'll stand by her pillow
and look out for her until dawn.

126
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,540
I'll sing her a lullaby too.

127
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:02,670
The bookstore we went to
Together that day

128
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:08,509
Turned into a convenience store
Before we knew it

129
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:14,974
That curry shop where I got stood up

130
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:20,646
Still serves baked potato
With their curry

131
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,692
You're just an insignificant bug

132
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,570
And I'm your freeloader

133
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,990
We share a 100-square-foot room

134
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:34,160
That's completely crammed with books

135
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:42,209
You seemed to be really happy

136
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:48,507
But I was always paranoid
About the floors falling through

137
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,594
Jinbocho

138
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:54,597
What a life we lived

139
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,600
Jinbocho

140
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:01,771
Those youthful days are now

141
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,691
Long gone

142
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,068
What's with that song?

143
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:09,653
Sorry I woke you.

144
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,239
It's a song I wrote myself.

145
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,784
"Jinbocho Elegy."

146
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,161
There are six verses to it!

147
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,871
Who do you think you are?

148
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,500
What? It's quite the masterpiece,
isn't it?

149
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,794
You woke me up.

150
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,921
Don't be a dick!

151
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:30,508
By the sixth verse
of "Jinbocho Elegy,"

152
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:34,470
we fly away together on a balloon
out into the universe.

153
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:39,600
Now I'm intrigued.

154
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,602
Then let's continue!

155
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,646
Please don't.

156
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,689
Jashin-chan...

157
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,068
Thank you.

158
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:56,242
Minos took you to the hospital
and Medusa took care of the bill.

159
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,160
So thank them.

160
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:01,872
I didn't care that you were sick
at all.

161
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,210
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

162
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,711
Make me something.

163
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,713
You're so dependent on me.

164
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,717
Why don't I make some gruel
with ginger to blast that cold away?

165
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:17,429
Wait, she has an appetite!
She's recovering quick!

166
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,226
Shit. She's gonna retaliate
against me.

167
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:25,271
I'm not doing anything.

168
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,022
Cool.

169
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,692
Drink, but do not drink away
your reason.

170
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,653
Catch a cold, but do not--

171
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,990
Hey, Yurine.

172
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,242
Do you know about the Ryounkaku?

173
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,660
Ryounkaku?

174
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:44,790
My friend in Hell is telling me
to go see the Ryounkaku in Asakusa.

175
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:48,460
It's a big, tall building
and a great tourist attraction.

176
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:51,380
Sounds familiar.

177
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,383
You're talking about this.

178
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,759
The Ryounkaku.

179
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:59,179
The first building to have
electric elevators in Japan.

180
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:03,142
It was demolished due to damages
from the Great Kanto earthquake.

181
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,602
What a shame.

182
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:06,520
Now that I think about it,

183
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:10,357
she did mention she visited
the human world 100 years ago.

184
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:11,901
Could you keep it down?

185
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,320
Go to Oshiage instead.

186
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,989
I already did with Medusa.

187
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,199
What? I've never been.

188
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,410
I've never been!

189
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,203
Me neither.

190
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,290
We tend to overlook
local touristy things, right?

191
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:28,709
It's true. Believe it or not,

192
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:32,171
-I've never been to the Tokyo Tower.
-See?

193
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,382
Well, aren't you such
a Tokyo devil now?

194
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:38,761
But that's too bad
about the Ryounkaku.

195
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,972
I was 100 years too late.

196
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:44,558
I envy you guys.

197
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,479
You guys easily live past 100 years.

198
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,566
If I could live thousands of years
like you guys,

199
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,612
I could witness more
historically-significant events.

200
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:57,863
Help me...

201
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,827
Humans are limited to witnessing
only 70 to 80 years of history.

202
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:08,082
I know I'll be gone in 100 years.

203
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,503
If peace continues
to thrive in the world,

204
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,381
I'd like to live
a couple hundred years

205
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,801
to witness the transformation.

206
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,638
You guys are able to do that.

207
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:25,140
I guess so.

208
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:30,437
It seems like nothing to us,
but it's a big deal for humans.

209
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:34,984
I'm curious about the future
of this world too.

210
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:39,029
Sure, humans live a short time
but their legacy gets passed on

211
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,991
and that's what shapes
the present world, right?

212
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,159
That's fascinating!

213
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,870
Your life is short but meaningful.

214
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,623
Makes living thousands of years
look lazy.

215
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,462
That's why I like
and respect humans.

216
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,716
Sure, humans are destructive,
but beyond that,

217
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:02,636
they have the power to imagine
many great things.

218
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,680
I still despise humans.

219
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,181
Jashin-chan!

220
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,559
But, I do like the human world.

221
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,562
Lots of fun things to do.

222
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,940
Lots of delicious food to eat!

223
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:17,568
It all comes down to that, huh?

224
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:21,071
I got hungry just thinking that.

225
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,281
Jeez.

226
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,867
Let's go eat!

227
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:28,328
Medusa, how about
expensive yakiniku? What do you say?

228
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,206
-I can't say no to you.
-Score!

229
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,460
Don't be a mooch.
I'll pitch in too, Medusa.

230
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,629
Hey, I wanna join you guys too!

231
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,507
-Don't be a mooch, Minos.
-Look who's talking!

232
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,010
Shut up! You want my dropkick?

233
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:45,471
I'll attack you back, no problem.

234
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,348
Don't make a scene
at the restaurant, please.

235
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,357
Flower viewing? I'm not going.

236
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,567
Why not?

237
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:03,781
I'm an angel. I refuse to picnic
amongst you devils.

238
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,533
Don't be a downer,
aren't we friends?

239
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,037
No, since when?

240
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:13,373
We prepared food for you too.

241
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,459
Food...?

242
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:18,796
What kind of food?

243
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,089
Let's see...

244
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:23,550
We've got yakitori,
sushi and sandwiches.

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,438
This is a prime spot.

246
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:39,066
How long have you
been claiming this spot?

247
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:42,736
Why aren't you answering?

248
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,321
Oh, hey.

249
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,492
Jashin-chan was here for 66 hours.

250
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,369
Sixty-six hours?

251
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:55,958
She was punished for hiding
a half-eaten sandwich in my desk.

252
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,168
Saving it for later!

253
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,089
I banned her from having
the smartphone,

254
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,883
games, and books for 66 hours.

255
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,677
You're relentless.

256
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:08,387
Cheers!

257
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,472
Cheers.

258
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,061
Drinks under the cherry blossoms,
how elegant. I love Japan!

259
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,648
You're such a tourist, Minos.

260
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,650
Hey, you guys!

261
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,819
You're too young to drink!

262
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,406
Oh, it's Orochimaru!

263
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:34,621
We must be destined for each other.

264
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,708
Stop! Don't do this to me!

265
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,630
Besides Yurine, the fallen angel
and devils here are all of age!

266
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,507
I'm not a fallen angel.

267
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:49,178
I'm at least a hundred times older
than you, Mei.

268
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,763
You called me Mei!

269
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,141
We're getting so intimate!

270
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:59,521
Let's recognize this day
as "Mei Orochimaru Day" forever!

271
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,441
Let's celebrate with a drink!

272
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,026
Aren't you on the clock?

273
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:07,446
It's fine, this job
isn't too serious.

274
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:14,536
There's a dead body buried
under the cherry blossom tree.

275
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,122
May they rest in peace.

276
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,086
I don't really want to do this job.

277
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,380
I chose it for its stability

278
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,508
but I end up getting scorned
every day.

279
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,511
She's such a downer.

280
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,057
Go and abandon her somewhere.

281
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,142
Now!

282
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:41,813
Why don't we go for a walk?

283
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,191
That sounds so tough.

284
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,443
You must be so stressed.

285
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,780
All right, it's time to party!

286
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,990
How about some meat buns?

287
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,742
That sounds great!

288
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,286
-I'd like some!
-Of course.

289
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:59,081
-Oh, hey, Noel.
-Damn it, not again.

290
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,041
Isn't that Poporon?

291
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,668
Pekola too?

292
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,170
Is she your friend, Pekola?

293
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:09,383
Damn it, Noel. So you are Poporon!

294
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:13,136
Hey, Noel,
it's time for your break.

295
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:15,681
Boss.

296
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,016
-Hey there, Yurine.
-Hello.

297
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:22,729
Noel's a good girl.
Hope you guys get along.

298
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,150
A good girl?

299
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,613
-Why don't you join us?
-You're Pekola's friend, right?

300
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,492
Right?

301
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,411
None of your business.

302
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,748
Poporon, don't be so rude.

303
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:43,166
Shut up!

304
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,169
How could you befriend
humans and devils?

305
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:48,130
Stop being an ass!

306
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:51,383
I'll set you straight.
Let's go outside!

307
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,218
We are outside!

308
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:55,470
Quit it, Jashin-chan.

309
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,557
Sorry for pressuring you.

310
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,267
Maybe next time.

311
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,770
Goodbye.

312
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,023
Damn it, Noel!

313
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,733
She's a thorny one.

314
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,360
She used to be my subordinate.

315
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,530
But she is a bit corrupt
for an angel.

316
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,908
She wasn't like that before.

317
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,828
Who cares?

318
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,788
Let's drink and sing it away!

319
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:26,877
Cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms

320
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,506
In fields, mountains, and villages

321
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:35,802
As far as you can go

322
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,016
Is it mist or clouds?

323
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,603
Jeez, what a joke.

324
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:47,397
Yeah!

325
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,817
And then, and then...

326
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:54,196
They all bully and call me
the strange girl.

327
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,490
That's so mean.

328
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,702
They must've forgotten about me
by now...

329
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:03,830
MEI OROCHIMARU DAY

330
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:11,046
I'm feeling the withdrawals
of zero recent devil activity.

331
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,468
How about bread for lunch?

332
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,596
I'm in the mood for a rice dish.

333
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:23,100
Really? It's about time
you craved bread.

334
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,810
Well, I don't.

335
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:26,103
-I want--
-No.

336
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,688
You look like you want bread.

337
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,233
-Yes.
-See?

338
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:35,070
It seemed like you could kill
for some bread.

339
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:40,033
I love the smell of a bakery.

340
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,160
The pleasant smell of yeast.

341
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:46,373
This fresh bread looks great.

342
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:49,918
Delicious!
Maybe I should get that one.

343
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:54,089
But this one looks good too.

344
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,134
Did you just...?

345
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,678
It said "Please help yourself."

346
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,806
What kind of person
hogs all the samples?

347
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,891
But I'm not a person.

348
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,226
I'm a devil.

349
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,567
I'll take some bread
and tear it into pieces...

350
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:16,111
Stab it with some toothpicks...

351
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:18,113
Voila, just like new!

352
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,740
You think you're so clever!

353
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,743
You just tore apart
a perfect piece of bread!

354
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,539
You'd better apologize
and pay for it.

355
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,040
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:38,133
I'll switch the ham roll's label
with the choco-cornet's!

357
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:44,222
That'll stump everyone.
They'll look so dumb!

358
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,439
Why are you so mischievous today?

359
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:58,278
Maybe you just don't notice
that I'm mischievous every day?

360
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,993
Blame my devilish instincts!
I get an itch to be bad at times.

361
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:09,789
Medusa and Minos are devils too
and they're not bad at all.

362
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:12,626
That's their distinct personalities.

363
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,879
You're so full of shit.

364
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:17,839
My balloon...

365
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:20,842
Mom, could you get it?

366
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,970
It went way too far up.

367
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,600
-You can redeem yourself.
-How?

368
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,352
Get the balloon for them.

369
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,853
No way.

370
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,940
-I don't help humans.
-What a shame.

371
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,278
Wouldn't it be a piece of cake
for you to get that balloon?

372
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:43,740
Well, that's totally true.

373
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,992
All right, I'll help.

374
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,620
Flatter a devil to get your way.

375
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:53,500
There. Here's your balloon, kiddo.

376
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,757
Whoa, what's happening?
How could you hold this thing?

377
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:03,760
Are you kidding me?

378
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,391
That's Jashin-chan!

379
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:14,187
I finally found you!
Wait up, Jashin-chan!

380
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,660
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

381
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:33,582
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

382
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:38,920
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

383
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:43,300
As she starves to death

384
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,760
It's a love and hate relationship

385
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,096
Can't leave each other alone

386
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:52,726
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

387
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:56,938
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

388
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,357
Test my heart, don't stop

389
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:06,448
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

390
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:10,827
We're a happy family

391
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:14,956
Let me say, I love you

392
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:17,417
When all is said and done

393
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:21,963
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

394
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,509
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

395
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,720
For another crazy tomorrow

396
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:32,432
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

397
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,310
Until we meet again!

398
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:39,356
Hasta la vista, baby.

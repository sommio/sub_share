1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,630
Won't leave

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,344
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,517
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,542
If you go too far

9
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,546
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,923
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,969
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,265
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:00,394
I'll never give up

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,146
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,661
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,873
But until then

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,556
Wish I could stop by the arcade.

22
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,393
The new mango figure
was just released.

23
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,522
But since I bought
refrigerated groceries,

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,940
I really can't.

25
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,902
-Poor me. I want a mango figure.
-Here she comes.

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,197
Since it's the perfect weather...

27
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,916
Over here!

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,836
What do you think
of my Light Sword?

29
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,045
Sword?

30
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,422
This is payback for last time.

31
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,550
-Potato!
-Potato?

32
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,052
Hey! I'm Jashin-chan, not Potato!

33
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,429
Who the hell are you anyway?

34
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm Poporon, the angel you threw
over the cliff and into the ocean.

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,652
I can't recall...

36
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,196
How could you forget?

37
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,827
That's Yurine's Polar Bear almond jelly!
How could you?

38
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,080
Not my problem.
Are you even listening to me?

39
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,083
This is bad. This is really bad.

40
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,587
Grocery shopping isn't that hard.

41
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,300
It hurts!

42
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:01,098
Damn it! First you spill my curry
and now my almond jelly?

43
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,100
-Not my problem.
-Damn you!

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,022
If I knew this was gonna happen,
I would've just gone to the arcade!

45
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,400
-I would've gotten that mango!
-As an angel,

46
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,611
I can't allow myself lose to a devil.

47
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,405
My mango. My precious mango...

48
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,698
Listen to me!

49
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:23,245
You devils are painful to look at!
A worthless, inferior species!

50
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,622
Get out of my sight!

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,123
Nope.

52
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,875
-Do it!
-Nope.

53
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,127
I refuse to obey you.

54
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,380
I've had it! Now you're going to die!

55
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:40,137
Impressed? I trained to stop swords
with my bare hands, just in case.

56
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,098
But why? You're okay...?

57
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,600
That thorn got you...

58
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,769
That hurts!

59
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,354
Such an idiot.

60
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,483
You treat devils like shit
because you think you're superior?

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,735
You don't deserve
to be an angel!

62
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,956
What's happening?
I feel so much energy!

63
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,043
Now that I've absorbed angel powers,

64
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,296
I'm Super Jashin-chan,
a fusion of justice and evil!

65
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,298
The halo had that kind of power?

66
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,677
Just kidding.

67
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,137
It only lit up for a second.

68
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,931
How disappointing.

69
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,559
Without my halo,
I can't use my powers!

70
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,269
Victory!

71
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,939
So, what was that about the Light Sword?

72
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,526
Without your powers,
that's just a thorny bat.

73
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,695
What are you gonna do, huh?

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,366
I guess it's our time, the devils,
the inferior species, to shine!

75
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,826
How exciting!

76
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,036
Here I go!

77
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,165
You better brace yourself!

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,253
Why so serious?
Come on, it was all a joke.

79
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,797
Angels and devils,
we should all be friends!

80
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,133
Say no to Armageddon!

81
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,801
See you later!

82
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,679
Pretty devious for an angel.

83
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,266
-She reminds me of someone.
-Her!

84
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,475
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,561
The Polar Bear almond jelly...

86
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,314
She'll be furious.

87
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,818
The perfect weapon for an angel.

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,452
Medusa showed me a great curry shop
the other day called Manten.

89
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,954
Their portions are huge. It's really good too.

90
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:33,709
Yurine made me replace the poisoned cake
I was gonna give Minos.

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,545
Oh, so where's Medusa?

92
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,965
-She's out with some friend.
-Friend?

93
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,717
What's wrong?

94
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,094
Medusa has a friend?

95
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,930
Besides me?

96
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,224
ATM.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,351
I'M TOO BUSY FOR YOU,
AT THE MOMENT.

98
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,395
That traitor!

99
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:58,150
-Hey Jashin-chan. You there?
-Who is this other friend, anyway?

100
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,110
Are you really gonna eat that?

101
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,990
Damn it! I'm gonna call her
and make her come here!

102
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,494
Daimaruyaki!

103
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
Gotta split, it's time for my shift.

104
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,005
You cunning bitch!
Who the hell are you seeing?

105
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,592
Who are you seeing besides me?

106
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,469
Seriously?

107
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,097
How did you know?

108
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
So, it's true?

109
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,393
You whore!
Now you show your true colors!

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,312
-Are you jealous?
-What?

111
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,482
Medusa's free
to have other friends.

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,026
Jealous? Not at all.

113
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,238
I'm fine. I'm not bothered at all.

114
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,615
But, I just can't seem
to forgive her.

115
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,742
That's called jealously, my friend.

116
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,993
Now spill it!

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,454
Who were you with,
you backstabber?

118
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,081
Well...

119
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,003
So, now you're feeling guilty
and can't find the words to say?

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:05,509
-You always said you loved me! Jeez!
-I'll be at the bookstore.

121
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,094
Not so fast!

122
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,848
You better listen to what
this bitch has to say!

123
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,016
Shut up.

124
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,726
You're so mean.

125
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,021
Why do you keep calling me a bitch
and a backstabber?

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,232
Crying's not gonna help.

127
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,610
Just give me an explanation.

128
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,781
I thought I had to keep it to myself.

129
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,868
-What?
-You told me not to tell.

130
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,452
A few days ago...

131
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,792
I spent 5000 yen in an attempt
to get a prize at the arcade...

132
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:43,797
And all I got was a grape figure!
What a damn waste!

133
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,342
That's why I'm so worked up right now.

134
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,387
I used up all my allowance.

135
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,683
Medusa, do you love me?

136
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,937
What's the matter?
Of course I love you, Jashin-chan.

137
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:05,444
How will I survive when I'm so broke?
What am I supposed to do?

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,070
Don't cry!

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,532
-Don't worry, I'll work more.
-Really?

140
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,576
I'll take care of you.

141
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,287
Really? That's so nice of you.

142
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,708
-I wasn't expecting anything.
-It's okay.

143
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:24,588
But don't say you're doing this for me,
that'll make me look bad.

144
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,964
I won't, I promise.

145
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,719
I lied to Minos to keep our secret.

146
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,348
But you put me on the spot
in front of Yurine...

147
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:40,354
You kept calling me a bitch
and accused me of being guilty.

148
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,523
Yurine, we'll meet you
at the bookstore.

149
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,108
Too late, huh?

150
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,780
Sorry about the name-calling.
So, who called you a bitch?

151
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,117
Come on, tell me.
I'll go beat them up.

152
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,579
-You're the worst!
-Jashin-chan.

153
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,999
You really are the worst
of the worst.

154
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,627
I actually feel bad for you.

155
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,172
Even for a devil, you're pretty low.

156
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,176
You're not going to do anything to me?

157
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,304
Medusa, I'll walk you to the station.

158
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,557
Munch.

159
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,854
What is this feeling?

160
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,733
That defeated look on Yurine's face...

161
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,655
She's basically saying I'm so worthless
I don't even deserve to be punished.

162
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,579
My stomach's upset.

163
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,833
I can't take this humiliation!

164
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,130
Are you crying?

165
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,673
I am.

166
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,383
So you're puking.

167
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,468
Clean up after yourself.

168
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,866
Hello.

169
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,202
Hey!

170
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,746
Minos.

171
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,874
There's a message from Jashin-chan.

172
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,376
It's for you, Medusa.

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,670
Thank you for waiting.

174
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,258
Looking back at yesterday,

175
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:38,055
I think I may have been at fault,
just a tiny bit.

176
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,226
To make up for it,
I'll give you my full attention today.

177
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,187
Meet me in Shibuya at 1.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,022
See you there.

179
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,566
Jashin-chan...

180
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,196
Since she's broke,
she caused a ruckus in front of my place

181
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,948
but I didn't notice because I was asleep.

182
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,451
She left that note in my mailbox.

183
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,954
It's okay!
That's why I'm working more.

184
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,708
I support Jashin-chan
when she's in need! See you!

185
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,126
Hey, the curry!

186
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,837
Sorry, could you eat it for me? Thanks!

187
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,631
I'll leave the money here!

188
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,966
-Thank you.
-Sweet!

189
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,719
I'll wear that thing I bought last time!

190
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,263
I'm gonna surprise her!

191
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,892
Weren't you going out?

192
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,229
I'm headed out soon.
We're meeting at 1.

193
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,189
Must be one on the dot.

194
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,482
Yeah, it is.

195
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,984
That jingle!

196
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,780
Congratulations, Jashin-chan.
You've reached the next level.

197
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,990
What's that?

198
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,577
She's Tangan-chan.
A low-class messenger devil.

199
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,787
I see.

200
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,875
Since you've reached the next level,
you've earned a reward.

201
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,627
All right!

202
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,046
What's gonna happen now?

203
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,968
-I get a bunch of perks too.
-Perks?

204
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,763
Let's see, free train passes,
luxury hotel vouchers...

205
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:07,394
I also get generous supermarket coupons,
and a whole lot more!

206
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,896
Are you a stockholder or something?

207
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:15,110
Hey, but I never killed anything
to advance to the next level.

208
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,865
The other day, you stripped an angel
of her powers by eating her halo.

209
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,367
That qualified you for advancement.

210
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,537
Awesome!
I better eat more halos then!

211
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,416
Since you can't go back home to hell,

212
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,545
Mr. Satan sent you this as a reward.

213
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,589
What's that?

214
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,049
Long story short,

215
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,052
that's a by-product
of Mr. Satan's research

216
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,055
-into black magic.
-It's a long story. Snack time.

217
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,559
He used a secret method to produce

218
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,562
this super uber exciting
cosmic concoction

219
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,564
that does wonders for your body.

220
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,483
That's all.

221
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,987
-This is the ultimate energy drink.
-Correct.

222
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,907
Maybe I could kill Yurine now.

223
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,201
My duties are done here.

224
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,578
This is goodbye!

225
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,580
She exploded.

226
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:14,211
Tangan-chan self-destructs
when her duties are done.

227
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,837
That's intense.

228
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,299
But when a devil dies
in the human world,

229
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,303
they regenerate as a higher class devil
in hell, so it's all good.

230
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,183
Cheers to you, Tangan-chan.

231
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,605
That stench!

232
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,234
Is this really okay to drink?

233
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,236
JASHIN-CHAN, DRINK UP!
FROM SATAN

234
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,824
It's probably not as bad as it smells.

235
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,992
Right?

236
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,538
If you're gonna drink it,
do it now. It stinks.

237
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,002
That was horrible! Gross!

238
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,755
-Disgusting!
-Unexpectedly bad, huh?

239
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,261
Yum, so good.

240
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,307
How dare you eat pudding
while I suffer? Give me a bite!

241
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:13,812
No way. I keep my dessert
all to myself.

242
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:18,900
Damn it! I'm gonna get Medusa
to buy me all the sweets I want!

243
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,570
What the hell?

244
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,530
I tripped over nothing!

245
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,825
Jashin-chan, look at you.

246
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,710
I bet it'll surprise her.

247
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,044
Hey!

248
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,715
Jashin-chan? Why are you wearing clothes?

249
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,592
You look so cute!

250
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,678
I'm not cute, I'm strong.

251
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,346
Sorry for the wait.

252
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,432
No problem.

253
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,684
I got here early.

254
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,564
But I think people were starting
to get suspicious after a while.

255
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,318
Jashin-chan, you have legs!

256
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,320
You finally noticed.

257
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,572
Look at you.

258
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,575
I grew legs!

259
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,578
-Because of this?
-Must be.

260
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,832
Growing legs will make me
more powerful, huh?

261
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,461
You're making the animator's job hard
by being nude.

262
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,087
Here, wear some clothes.

263
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,134
Question. Is this underwear brand new?

264
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,094
Never worn!

265
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,433
Medusa's gonna flip out
when she sees me like this.

266
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,603
So that's the story.
Is your mind blown?

267
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,857
That's amazing how you got
a reward like that from Mr. Satan!

268
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,401
Hey, where's your paper bag?

269
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,366
I'm wearing contacts
that prevent petrification.

270
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,076
What? That's genius!

271
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:55,372
Now you can walk around the human world
without a paper bag?

272
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,623
That's right!

273
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,793
I'm happy for you, Medusa.

274
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,088
Hey, Jashin-chan.

275
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,218
I wanna wear clothes like you.
Help me pick something out.

276
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,144
This one's cute.

277
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,271
They all look the same to me.

278
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,232
How's this?

279
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,234
Looks good on you.

280
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,236
Really? Thanks.

281
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,240
It feels so refreshing
to not have to wear a bag around town.

282
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,202
This is a whole new world for me,
it's so fun.

283
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:39,833
Medusa's having the time of her life.
She must have dreaded wearing the bag.

284
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,505
Aren't you happy you grew legs too?
You seem to like them a lot.

285
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:49,300
It's not that exciting.
I'm still getting used to them.

286
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,468
Look.

287
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,554
Angels in Shibuya.

288
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,598
Hey, lovely angels,
wanna go out with us?

289
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,891
We're devils!

290
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,727
-We got asked out.
-Help!

291
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,980
Losers.
They don't even know who we are.

292
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:16,244
-This is so cool. And yummy.
-I don't get humans. Is this cute?

293
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,748
Let's go see that later.

294
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,167
What's that? It's huge.

295
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,835
It's a unicorn!

296
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,548
Jashin-chan is here in Tokyo somewhere.

297
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,691
Jashin-chan, it's the ocean!

298
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,735
Are you okay?

299
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,944
Need help?

300
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,154
Hands off!

301
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,239
Scram, you fools!

302
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,076
-I'm still not used to these shoes.
-Are you okay?

303
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,662
Medusa, your legs!

304
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,874
What's happening...?

305
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,876
They're petrifying!

306
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,880
Let's move away from all the people.
Over there!

307
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,510
Could it be a side effect
from using those contact lenses?

308
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,513
Take them out for a second.

309
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,021
-The petrification is stopping.
-I knew it.

310
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,733
Petrification isn't that easy to prevent.

311
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,653
You got ripped off
by these cheap bastards.

312
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,531
I'll give them hell when I get back!

313
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,241
I'm sorry, Jashin-chan.

314
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,910
I just wanted us
to have a good time.

315
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,166
Instead I've upset you
and now I'm back to wearing the bag.

316
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,043
Don't cry, Medusa!

317
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,419
It's not...

318
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,006
It's not a nuisance for me at all.

319
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,969
Plus, there might be another way
to prevent the petrification.

320
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,679
Let's not give up.

321
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,182
You're right.

322
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:05,395
But that company's going down!
I'll never forgive them!

323
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:09,107
How could they sell
such cheap product?

324
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,947
What? Where am I?

325
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,326
-I bought them from you.
-Thanks for your business!

326
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:25,081
You're the corrupt seller
of these contact lenses?

327
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,668
Dropkick in Odaiba!

328
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,671
You brats!

329
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,799
My dropkick is even more destructive!

330
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,719
It might be powerful enough
to kill Yurine.

331
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,512
Thanks!

332
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,056
Jashin-chan, you're so kind.

333
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,434
What? Not at all.

334
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:48,688
That's what he gets
for making you waste your money.

335
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,482
And your money is my money!

336
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,276
Okay, okay.

337
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,448
-We should head home soon.
-Yup.

338
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,410
Sorry, but you gotta wear this bag again.

339
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,704
Get on my back.

340
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,625
You can't be walking
with those petrified legs.

341
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,588
Thanks, Jashin-chan.
I hope I'm not too heavy.

342
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,715
You are.
You should go on a diet.

343
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,634
Meanie...

344
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,346
I just felt something cold.
Did you just drool on me?

345
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,097
I did not.

346
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,688
Snow? Well, that's out of season.

347
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,878
What?

348
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,590
You carried Medusa all the way home
from Odaiba?

349
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,759
I'm pretty beat right now.

350
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,302
Sorry.

351
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,013
So you're not completely hopeless after all.

352
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,473
Well, barely.

353
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,851
Now that she thinks
there's a glimpse of good in me...

354
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,105
My dropkick's deadly
thanks to these legs!

355
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,731
Die, Yurine!

356
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,985
This is gonna be the final episode!

357
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,695
Jashin-chan Dropkick!

358
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,407
The final one before we start airing
the series of highlights

359
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:26,244
that was obviously put together
in a rush to make the deadline!

360
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,585
What? My tail's back.

361
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,880
I guess it only lasts
for a fixed period of time.

362
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,633
Boy, that's a bummer.

363
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,928
But I feel like myself again!

364
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,015
-I'll go make dinner now.
-Not so fast.

365
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,352
I was actually a little proud of you earlier

366
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,855
but you had to ruin it, didn't you?

367
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,482
You tried to kill me again.

368
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,110
Now that your tail's back,

369
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,572
why don't we serve live viper
for dinner tonight?

370
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,115
Please don't!

371
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,325
I don't wanna be eaten!

372
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,120
Jashin-chan,
thank you for an amazing day.

373
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,978
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

374
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,900
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

375
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:44,197
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

376
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:48,576
As she starves to death

377
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,120
It's a love and hate relationship

378
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,414
Can't leave each other alone

379
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:58,086
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

380
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,298
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

381
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,717
Test my heart, don't stop

382
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:11,766
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

383
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:16,020
We're a happy family

384
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,274
Let me say, I love you

385
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,777
When all is said and done

386
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:27,448
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

387
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:32,120
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

388
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,372
For another crazy tomorrow

389
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,084
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

390
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,714
Both have had their wings torn off
and have been traumatized.

391
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,176
But they are completely the opposite.
Two completely different angels.

392
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,720
And the devil goes beyond time.

393
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,430
Dropkick on My Devil!

394
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,600
We'll paro special into your heart
in the next episode too!

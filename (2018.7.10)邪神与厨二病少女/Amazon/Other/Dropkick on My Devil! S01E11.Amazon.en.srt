1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:04,672
Won't leave

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,344
Without a dropkick on her

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,517
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,532
-She summoned me, the evil god
-Evil god

5
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,076
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
-I can't go back to hell
-Sister...

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,542
If you go too far

9
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,546
I'll slice you up completely

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,923
Your halo
Must get it back

11
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,969
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:56,265
-To attack her from behind
-You're so mean

13
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:00,394
I'll never give up

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,146
Yurine, you're off your guard!

15
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,233
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,153
Huh? What? I missed...

17
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,573
Can't leave Earth

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,661
Without a dropkick on her

19
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,831
But until then

20
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,796
-Let's all have fun together
-Yeah!

21
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,886
Take this, Yurine!

22
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:40,768
Here's my grand entrance dropkick
to start off the final episode!

23
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,729
Even though
you'll probably dodge it.

24
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,028
I got her...

25
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,490
That hurt.

26
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,535
An eye for an eye.

27
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,541
I missed.

28
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,335
Oh, well, I forgive you.

29
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,296
Just get dinner ready, okay?

30
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:13,634
She never misses...

31
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,180
Tonight's dinner
is twice-cooked pork!

32
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:22,101
The cabbage and pork belly
were a steal today.

33
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,437
Delicious!

34
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,607
You like twice-cooked pork, right?

35
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,360
Yurine?

36
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,030
Yeah, I do.

37
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,242
You make it really good too.

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,371
But it seems like your appetite
is shot.

39
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,665
I'm already full.

40
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm gonna go lie down for a bit.

41
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,633
She left so much.

42
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,303
Was it the cheap pork belly?

43
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:02,099
That can't be. I prepared it
so you couldn't even tell.

44
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,851
Yup, it's delicious.

45
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,855
Something's wrong.
Yurine never leaves leftovers.

46
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,318
Yurine, are you okay?

47
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,403
Do you have a fever?

48
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,488
You're burning up!

49
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,491
Where's the thermometer?

50
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,455
102 degrees?

51
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,750
Isn't that really high for humans?

52
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,419
Blankets! Blankets!

53
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,380
Lie down here.
Oh, yeah, water-filled pillows!

54
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,009
Put it under your head!

55
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,303
Time to change into pajamas!

56
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,725
Now we need medicine
to lower her fever...

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,103
Which, we don't have.

58
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,439
This should help for now.

59
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,442
Good, now she's rested.

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,611
What the hell am I doing?

61
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,073
Why am I taking care of her?

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,370
She's the very reason
I can't go back to Hell.

63
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,089
She summoned me without knowing
the return spell.

64
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,259
In order for me to return,
she has to die.

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,513
I'm an idiot.

66
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:27,309
This is my prime opportunity
to kill her while she's weak!

67
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,644
Jashin-chan...

68
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,647
Water...

69
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,565
Not my problem.

70
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,151
Go get it yourself.

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,702
She's halfway there.
I might as well leave her to die.

72
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,621
Finally!

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,874
My long struggle
is about to come to an end!

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,712
Now, why don't I go celebrate
before my victorious return?

75
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,216
Didn't even need to end
her life myself.

76
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,843
Good-bye Yurine.

77
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,221
Living in the human world
wasn't all that bad.

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,479
I finally get to go home!

79
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:15,107
I'll be at the arcade until closing

80
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,402
and eat my last curry
on the way back.

81
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,113
Yurine will have to be dead by then!

82
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,662
We'll...

83
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,541
never meet again...

84
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,924
I'm cold...

85
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,926
What do you guys think?

86
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,637
She looks miserable,
her fever's too high.

87
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,681
She needs to see a doctor now.

88
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,142
Yeah, I'll go get the car.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,394
Jashin-chan, carry her down.

90
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,271
You bet!

91
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,315
Medusa, you get the bill!

92
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,692
Beth, you just stay home!

93
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,072
-By car, did you mean this?
-Yeah!

94
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,450
Trust me, this is the best way
to get around

95
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,619
Jinbocho's narrow streets.

96
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,579
Oh, okay.

97
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,956
Hold on tight!

98
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,713
Obey the speed limit, Minos!

99
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:23,717
Go, go, go!

100
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,011
She took her meds.

101
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,304
She'll recover now.

102
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,766
The doctor said
she'll be better in a couple days.

103
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,851
What a relief.

104
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,647
Never expected you'd save Yurine,
Jashin-chan.

105
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,899
See? I told you.

106
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,360
Jashin-chan's generous at heart.

107
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,988
Shut up! I'm the devil,
I'll knock you out!

108
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,453
If something happened to Yurine
because of my neglect,

109
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,873
you guys would've shunned me.

110
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,043
I do want to go home.

111
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,753
But...

112
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,257
I don't want to lose
you guys either.

113
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,594
Yeah, right.

114
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,389
You were genuinely concerned
for Yurine.

115
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:13,684
One more word
and I'll turn you into steak!

116
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,770
You better not get all cocky either,
Medusa.

117
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,983
-All I want is your money, not you!
-Sure, sure.

118
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,860
Damn it, you better listen!

119
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:27,239
Hey, quiet down.
You're gonna wake Yurine.

120
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,825
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

121
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,580
We're out of here.
Take good care of her, okay?

122
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,957
Thanks for your help.

123
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,463
Now...

124
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,803
Let's practice good bedside manners.

125
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,724
I'll stand by her pillow
and look out for her until dawn.

126
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,060
I'll sing her a lullaby too.

127
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:02,149
The bookstore we went to
Together that day

128
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,988
Turned into a convenience store
Before we knew it

129
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:14,494
That curry shop where I got stood up

130
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:20,125
Still serves baked potato
With their curry

131
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,213
You're just an insignificant bug

132
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,049
And I'm your freeloader

133
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,469
We share a 100-square-foot room

134
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,680
That's completely crammed with books

135
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,688
You seemed to be really happy

136
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:47,986
But I was always paranoid
About the floors falling through

137
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,114
Jinbocho

138
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,076
What a life we lived

139
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,120
Jinbocho

140
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,291
Those youthful days are now

141
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,212
Long gone

142
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,547
What's with that song?

143
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,174
Sorry I woke you.

144
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,760
It's a song I wrote myself.

145
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,304
"Jinbocho Elegy."

146
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,682
There are six verses to it!

147
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,350
Who do you think you are?

148
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,020
What? It's quite the masterpiece,
isn't it?

149
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,314
You woke me up.

150
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't be a dick!

151
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,987
By the sixth verse
of "Jinbocho Elegy,"

152
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,991
we fly away together on a balloon
out into the universe.

153
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,079
Now I'm intrigued.

154
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,123
Then let's continue!

155
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,125
Please don't.

156
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,168
Jashin-chan...

157
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,547
Thank you.

158
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:55,762
Minos took you to the hospital
and Medusa took care of the bill.

159
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
So thank them.

160
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,393
I didn't care that you were sick
at all.

161
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,731
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

162
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,232
Make me something.

163
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,234
You're so dependent on me.

164
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,196
Why don't I make some gruel
with ginger to blast that cold away?

165
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,950
Wait, she has an appetite!
She's recovering quick!

166
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,705
Shit. She's gonna retaliate
against me.

167
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,750
I'm not doing anything.

168
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,543
Cool.

169
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,212
Drink, but do not drink away
your reason.

170
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,174
Catch a cold, but do not--

171
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,469
Hey, Yurine.

172
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,763
Do you know about the Ryounkaku?

173
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,181
Ryounkaku?

174
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:44,269
My friend in Hell is telling me
to go see the Ryounkaku in Asakusa.

175
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,981
It's a big, tall building
and a great tourist attraction.

176
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,859
Sounds familiar.

177
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,904
You're talking about this.

178
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,280
The Ryounkaku.

179
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,658
The first building to have
electric elevators in Japan.

180
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,662
It was demolished due to damages
from the Great Kanto earthquake.

181
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,122
What a shame.

182
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,041
Now that I think about it,

183
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,836
she did mention she visited
the human world 100 years ago.

184
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,380
Could you keep it down?

185
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,840
Go to Oshiage instead.

186
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,468
I already did with Medusa.

187
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,678
What? I've never been.

188
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,889
I've never been!

189
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,724
Me neither.

190
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,811
We tend to overlook
local touristy things, right?

191
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,188
It's true. Believe it or not,

192
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,691
-I've never been to the Tokyo Tower.
-See?

193
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,903
Well, aren't you such
a Tokyo devil now?

194
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,281
But that's too bad
about the Ryounkaku.

195
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,493
I was 100 years too late.

196
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,037
I envy you guys.

197
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,958
You guys easily live past 100 years.

198
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,045
If I could live thousands of years
like you guys,

199
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,133
I could witness more
historically-significant events.

200
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,384
Help me...

201
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:03,306
Humans are limited to witnessing
only 70 to 80 years of history.

202
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,602
I know I'll be gone in 100 years.

203
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,023
If peace continues
to thrive in the world,

204
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,860
I'd like to live
a couple hundred years

205
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,321
to witness the transformation.

206
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,117
You guys are able to do that.

207
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,661
I guess so.

208
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,916
It seems like nothing to us,
but it's a big deal for humans.

209
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,504
I'm curious about the future
of this world too.

210
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,508
Sure, humans live a short time
but their legacy gets passed on

211
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,511
and that's what shapes
the present world, right?

212
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,680
That's fascinating!

213
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,349
Your life is short but meaningful.

214
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,144
Makes living thousands of years
look lazy.

215
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,983
That's why I like
and respect humans.

216
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,195
Sure, humans are destructive,
but beyond that,

217
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,115
they have the power to imagine
many great things.

218
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,159
I still despise humans.

219
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,702
Jashin-chan!

220
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,038
But, I do like the human world.

221
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,082
Lots of fun things to do.

222
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,461
Lots of delicious food to eat!

223
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,047
It all comes down to that, huh?

224
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,592
I got hungry just thinking that.

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
Jeez.

226
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,346
Let's go eat!

227
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,807
Medusa, how about
expensive yakiniku? What do you say?

228
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,685
-I can't say no to you.
-Score!

229
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,980
Don't be a mooch.
I'll pitch in too, Medusa.

230
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,108
Hey, I wanna join you guys too!

231
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,986
-Don't be a mooch, Minos.
-Look who's talking!

232
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,531
Shut up! You want my dropkick?

233
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,991
I'll attack you back, no problem.

234
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,827
Don't make a scene
at the restaurant, please.

235
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,836
Flower viewing? I'm not going.

236
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,046
Why not?

237
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,301
I'm an angel. I refuse to picnic
amongst you devils.

238
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,054
Don't be a downer,
aren't we friends?

239
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,516
No, since when?

240
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,894
We prepared food for you too.

241
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,938
Food...?

242
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,275
What kind of food?

243
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,568
Let's see...

244
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,029
We've got yakitori,
sushi and sandwiches.

245
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,917
This is a prime spot.

246
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,545
How long have you
been claiming this spot?

247
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,215
Why aren't you answering?

248
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,842
Oh, hey.

249
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,013
Jashin-chan was here for 66 hours.

250
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,848
Sixty-six hours?

251
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,437
She was punished for hiding
a half-eaten sandwich in my desk.

252
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,647
Saving it for later!

253
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,568
I banned her from having
the smartphone,

254
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,404
games, and books for 66 hours.

255
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,156
You're relentless.

256
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,866
Cheers!

257
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,993
Cheers.

258
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,582
Drinks under the cherry blossoms,
how elegant. I love Japan!

259
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,127
You're such a tourist, Minos.

260
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,171
Hey, you guys!

261
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,298
You're too young to drink!

262
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,885
Oh, it's Orochimaru!

263
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,142
We must be destined for each other.

264
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,187
Stop! Don't do this to me!

265
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:43,151
Besides Yurine, the fallen angel
and devils here are all of age!

266
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,986
I'm not a fallen angel.

267
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,657
I'm at least a hundred times older
than you, Mei.

268
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,284
You called me Mei!

269
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,662
We're getting so intimate!

270
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:59,042
Let's recognize this day
as "Mei Orochimaru Day" forever!

271
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,920
Let's celebrate with a drink!

272
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,505
Aren't you on the clock?

273
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,925
It's fine, this job
isn't too serious.

274
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:14,015
There's a dead body buried
under the cherry blossom tree.

275
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,643
May they rest in peace.

276
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,565
I don't really want to do this job.

277
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,859
I chose it for its stability

278
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,987
but I end up getting scorned
every day.

279
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,032
She's such a downer.

280
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,536
Go and abandon her somewhere.

281
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,663
Now!

282
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,334
Why don't we go for a walk?

283
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,670
That sounds so tough.

284
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,964
You must be so stressed.

285
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,300
All right, it's time to party!

286
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,511
How about some meat buns?

287
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,263
That sounds great!

288
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,765
-I'd like some!
-Of course.

289
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,601
-Oh, hey, Noel.
-Damn it, not again.

290
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,562
Isn't that Poporon?

291
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,147
Pekola too?

292
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,649
Is she your friend, Pekola?

293
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,903
Damn it, Noel. So you are Poporon!

294
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,615
Hey, Noel,
it's time for your break.

295
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,160
Boss.

296
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,495
-Hey there, Yurine.
-Hello.

297
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,250
Noel's a good girl.
Hope you guys get along.

298
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,671
A good girl?

299
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,134
-Why don't you join us?
-You're Pekola's friend, right?

300
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,013
Right?

301
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,890
None of your business.

302
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,227
Poporon, don't be so rude.

303
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,645
Shut up!

304
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,648
How could you befriend
humans and devils?

305
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,650
Stop being an ass!

306
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,904
I'll set you straight.
Let's go outside!

307
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,697
We are outside!

308
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,991
Quit it, Jashin-chan.

309
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,036
Sorry for pressuring you.

310
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,746
Maybe next time.

311
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,291
Goodbye.

312
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,543
Damn it, Noel!

313
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,253
She's a thorny one.

314
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,881
She used to be my subordinate.

315
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,009
But she is a bit corrupt
for an angel.

316
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,387
She wasn't like that before.

317
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,307
Who cares?

318
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,267
Let's drink and sing it away!

319
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:26,356
Cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms

320
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,985
In fields, mountains, and villages

321
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:35,323
As far as you can go

322
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,495
Is it mist or clouds?

323
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,123
Jeez, what a joke.

324
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,876
Yeah!

325
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,296
And then, and then...

326
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,675
They all bully and call me
the strange girl.

327
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,969
That's so mean.

328
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:00,223
They must've forgotten about me
by now...

329
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,309
MEI OROCHIMARU DAY

330
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,525
I'm feeling the withdrawals
of zero recent devil activity.

331
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,947
How about bread for lunch?

332
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,075
I'm in the mood for a rice dish.

333
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,579
Really? It's about time
you craved bread.

334
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,330
Well, I don't.

335
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,623
-I want--
-No.

336
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,167
You look like you want bread.

337
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,753
-Yes.
-See?

338
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,549
It seemed like you could kill
for some bread.

339
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,554
I love the smell of a bakery.

340
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,681
The pleasant smell of yeast.

341
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,894
This fresh bread looks great.

342
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,397
Delicious!
Maybe I should get that one.

343
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,568
But this one looks good too.

344
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,654
Did you just...?

345
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,157
It said "Please help yourself."

346
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,285
What kind of person
hogs all the samples?

347
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,412
But I'm not a person.

348
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,705
I'm a devil.

349
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,046
I'll take some bread
and tear it into pieces...

350
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,590
Stab it with some toothpicks...

351
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,634
Voila, just like new!

352
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,219
You think you're so clever!

353
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,264
You just tore apart
a perfect piece of bread!

354
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:27,018
You'd better apologize
and pay for it.

355
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,519
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:37,654
I'll switch the ham roll's label
with the choco-cornet's!

357
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:43,743
That'll stump everyone.
They'll look so dumb!

358
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,918
Why are you so mischievous today?

359
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:57,757
Maybe you just don't notice
that I'm mischievous every day?

360
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,514
Blame my devilish instincts!
I get an itch to be bad at times.

361
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,268
Medusa and Minos are devils too
and they're not bad at all.

362
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,105
That's their distinct personalities.

363
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,358
You're so full of shit.

364
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,318
My balloon...

365
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,363
Mom, could you get it?

366
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,449
It went way too far up.

367
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,121
-You can redeem yourself.
-How?

368
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,872
Get the balloon for them.

369
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,374
No way.

370
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,460
-I don't help humans.
-What a shame.

371
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,757
Wouldn't it be a piece of cake
for you to get that balloon?

372
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,261
Well, that's totally true.

373
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,513
All right, I'll help.

374
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,099
Flatter a devil to get your way.

375
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,979
There. Here's your balloon, kiddo.

376
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,236
Whoa, what's happening?
How could you hold this thing?

377
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,239
Are you kidding me?

378
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:08,911
That's Jashin-chan!

379
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,666
I finally found you!
Wait up, Jashin-chan!

380
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,181
Dropkick on her, yeah her
I'll take you down again

381
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,102
Hate you
Love doesn't exist in this world

382
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:38,399
Fear the dropkick
An angel looks for her halo

383
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,820
As she starves to death

384
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,281
It's a love and hate relationship

385
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,575
Can't leave each other alone

386
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:52,205
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star

387
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,417
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and die

388
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,836
Test my heart, don't stop

389
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:05,927
Let's go, dream on
No matter human, angel or devil

390
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:10,306
We're a happy family

391
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,435
Let me say, I love you

392
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,896
When all is said and done

393
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:21,484
I'm home
Welcome back, it's hot pot tonight

394
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,988
Come, gather everyone
Let's enjoy this meal

395
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,241
For another crazy tomorrow

396
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,953
What next? What next?
In the end, wake up

397
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,789
Until we meet again!

398
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,835
Hasta la vista, baby.

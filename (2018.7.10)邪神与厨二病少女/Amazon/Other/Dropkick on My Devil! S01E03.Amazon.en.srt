1
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,528
Minos.

2
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:09,405
What are you doing?

3
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,366
Oh, hey, Yurine.

4
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,202
I'm grilling lobsters.

5
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,704
Ta-da!

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,416
I think those are crawfi--

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,252
When I told Jashin-chan

8
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,837
I wanted to try lobster...

9
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:28,633
Big catch at Shimizu Canal
around the corner!

10
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,635
And then she gave me all this!

11
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:31,844
A BUNCH

12
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:34,764
-Want some?
-No.

13
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:36,307
-I'll grill some.
-No, thanks.

14
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,395
Looking good!

15
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,064
Let's try it.
Ouch! It's hot.

16
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,276
There. Let's eat!

17
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:50,238
Amazing! Nothing beats lobster!

18
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:51,656
100% BEEF

19
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,992
-Crawfish is good?
-Try some, Yurine!

20
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:55,618
-No, thanks.
-It's so crunchy.

21
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:01,207
Pretty darn good!

22
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,212
Won’t leave

23
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:11,968
without a dropkick on her!

24
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,182
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

25
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:33,156
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

26
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,658
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

27
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,535
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

28
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:41,247
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

29
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:43,166
If you go too far,

30
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:47,211
I’ll slice you up completely!

31
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,464
Your halo!
Must get it back!

32
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,593
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

33
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,805
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

34
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:02,018
I’ll never give up.

35
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:03,644
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

36
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:07,815
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

37
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,735
Huh? What? I missed…

38
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:14,155
Can’t leave Earth

39
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:19,285
without a dropkick on her!

40
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:22,455
But until then,

41
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:28,378
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

42
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,229
What about my present?

43
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,898
Of course I'll buy you one.

44
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:51,025
Really? Thanks!

45
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,486
That's right.

46
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,364
It's Christmas.

47
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:04,372
I'm so hungry.

48
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,835
It's Christmas.

49
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,921
And I'm having bread crust.

50
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,885
My Lord endured hardships too.

51
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:20,596
I should be grateful for the food I have!

52
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:29,355
-It's cold.
-So, what do you want for Christmas?

53
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:33,276
I want wealth, honor and status.

54
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,486
That's pretty mature of you.

55
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,448
I'm sure Santa will make it happen.

56
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:41,159
Then, I want love.

57
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,536
-Whoa, that's so cool.
-Right?

58
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,246
I want love.

59
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:47,331
So cool.

60
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:50,668
Santa? Must be talking about
Saint Nicholas.

61
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,753
He's got a lot on his plate.

62
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:56,174
How will he fulfill
these kids' wishes?

63
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,801
I wish for something
with bold flavor.

64
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,722
Why am I wishing
for a Christmas present

65
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,765
when I'm not even human!?

66
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:11,022
To begin with,
Christmas isn't even about presents!

67
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:17,778
Shoot, I'm choking!
I need something to drink!

68
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:21,866
MILK

69
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,451
That was close.

70
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,038
I almost drank it all.

71
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:29,916
This is all I have for today.

72
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,961
I'm grateful for the food I have.

73
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:39,675
But I'm craving something with more flavor.
Like curry.

74
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:44,013
Santa, will you visit an angel?

75
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:46,933
Delicious.

76
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:48,476
This smell...

77
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,686
So good.

78
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,731
-Curry?
-This curry is amazing.

79
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,984
Yurine Hanazono's familiar spirit.
Why is she here?

80
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,736
Wait, that hat.

81
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:02,281
-Is she Saint Nicholas' spirit?
-I got the take-out deal.

82
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,283
-So good!
-Was she sent for me?

83
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:09,956
-It was so good, I devoured it all.
-Nope.

84
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,708
I'll eat the second one too.

85
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,836
It smells wonderful!

86
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:18,381
Curry...

87
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,385
So juicy!

88
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:25,346
Juicy...

89
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,182
What are you staring at?

90
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,185
-None for you.
-I couldn't help it.

91
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,895
How embarrassing.

92
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:42,655
-I want that.
-Huh?

93
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,366
Give it to me.

94
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,245
You just had a feast.

95
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,455
This is all I have.

96
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:54,166
I finished my food, so give me that.

97
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,503
You glutton. You'll end up in Hell.

98
00:05:57,712 --> 00:06:00,506
Funny. I'm from there.

99
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,884
I don't care. I'm still hungry!

100
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:08,139
-Stop! This is all I have!
-Shut up! Give it to me!

101
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,477
M-My precious milk!

102
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,565
Your back's wide open!

103
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,859
Merry Christmas!

104
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,283
-Thanks.
-No!

105
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:31,203
Delicious! Stolen food
is out-of-this-world good.

106
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:34,248
It's a bit dry,
but delicious nonetheless.

107
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:36,542
H-How cruel.

108
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,712
You're the one who turned
your back on me.

109
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,048
And thanks for the compliment.

110
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,675
Give me back my precious food!

111
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:49,263
I'm not scared of you,
halo-less angel!

112
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,265
What the hell are you doing?

113
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,725
Ah! Yurine...

114
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:56,812
I told you to go home with the curry
while I got the chicken.

115
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,357
The witch, Yurine Hanazono.

116
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,486
-I don't know.
-Huh? What?

117
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:05,237
I don't know.

118
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:08,574
You ate the curry?

119
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,785
I-I don't know!

120
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,954
-Both of them?
-I don't know anything.

121
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,499
Where am I? Who am I?

122
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:19,919
I don't know.

123
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,546
-She ate it!
-What?

124
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,465
She's tiny, but she can eat.

125
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:27,385
-I told her no, but...
-Jashin-chan.

126
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,055
Why lie about it?

127
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,265
Fine, I ate it!

128
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,434
So?

129
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,028
Unbelievable.

130
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:52,076
-As punishment, no chicken for you.
-Oh come on...

131
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:55,913
T-Takoyaki... Blood...

132
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,958
-T-Takoyaki...
-Pekola.

133
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,504
Jashin-chan gave you a lot of trouble.

134
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,716
Please accept my apologies.

135
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,676
This is Jashin-chan's chicken.

136
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,637
Food with bold flavor!

137
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,641
I-I can't accept anything
from a witch.

138
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:17,393
No way!

139
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:21,021
I'm still an angel, you know?

140
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,566
You could've poisoned it too.

141
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,778
This is an apology, accept it.

142
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:30,531
To eat it or not is your choice.

143
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,536
Jashin-chan, we're going home.

144
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:40,958
It's time to decorate our place.
Wanna be the tree?

145
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:52,094
Chicken! With bold flavors.

146
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:53,804
Yurine Hanazono.

147
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:58,726
-You're a witch, but my Santa!
-Why don't I gift your meat to Beth?

148
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:00,436
Please don't...

149
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,276
You like it, huh?
Eat as much as you want.

150
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,823
Jashin-chan, do you know?

151
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:17,036
Why Santa's outfit is red?

152
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,748
It's because it's stained in blood.

153
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,585
Merry Christmas.

154
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,964
Merry Christmas-sacre! Huh?

155
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,597
Jashin-chan, where are you?

156
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:40,226
Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...

157
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:44,855
-Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...
-She's hopeless on the streets.

158
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:49,568
-Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...
-Will she ever find her?

159
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:52,822
I'm right here, getting crucified.

160
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:00,371
The seasons change
in a blink of an eye.

161
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:01,872
It's now deep autumn.

162
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:16,095
Done with training.

163
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:19,306
My own breathing method
is doing me great.

164
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,603
These abs will make my dropkick
more lethal.

165
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,857
Yurine, punch me in the stomach.

166
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,985
Test out these abs of steel.

167
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,236
All right.

168
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,492
Damn it.

169
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,953
Jashin-chan?

170
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:44,915
Coming!

171
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:51,088
Hello, my name is Yusa.

172
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,883
Thank you for taking care
of my sister.

173
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:56,385
Yusa? Um...

174
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:02,391
Enjoy.

175
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:04,184
Thank you.

176
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:06,896
I planned on eating this cake
all by myself!

177
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,522
REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS

178
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:12,276
Should've had it before my training!

179
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,909
Kori-chan saved us
during the summer.

180
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:27,124
But could you please stop the blizzard?
It's freezing.

181
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,001
Oh, of course.

182
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:34,798
I know you two are sisters,

183
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,551
but are you even the same organism?

184
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,303
Yes.

185
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:44,016
We, Ice Devils, change appearances
as we grow.

186
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:47,853
We're born with certain abilities
as a child.

187
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:51,523
But when we mature,
like I did,

188
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:55,277
we receive a name and become
a full-fledged devil.

189
00:11:55,486 --> 00:12:01,158
In human years, Ice Devils mature
at around 15 years old.

190
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,577
I see.

191
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:08,791
May I suggest Kori-chan's
future name?

192
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,376
How about Koji?

193
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:12,628
YUSA
KOJI

194
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:17,257
Isn't that a boy's name?

195
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,051
I guess so.

196
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:20,552
Koji?

197
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:23,305
So, what brings you here today?

198
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:27,434
Yes, we didn't mean to show up
unannounced,

199
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,896
but my sister begged me
to take her to see you.

200
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,065
We brought this for you.

201
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:40,072
-I heard she had fun with her.
-Damn it! Such a thin slice.

202
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,282
So, I wanted to thank her too.

203
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,916
Why the hell is she glaring
at me like she wants to kill me?

204
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,086
Is she actually here to kill me?

205
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,756
Mature Ice Devils
are high-class devils.

206
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,843
She could kill me in a second!

207
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,094
DEFEATIST WHEN FACING
STRONG DEVILS

208
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,305
Jashin-chan, did you do something?

209
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:13,063
She whistled in your ear
just to mess with you?

210
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:17,026
-You're only 95 yen.
-She stuck a bread-price tag on you?

211
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,695
Koji! You snitch!

212
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,364
You're such an idiot.

213
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:26,869
Now she's traumatized
with the sound of the whistle.

214
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,497
And she can't even step inside
a grocery store anymore.

215
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:31,874
That's ridiculous!

216
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,754
She's the low-class devil
who disobeyed me!

217
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,591
You insulted her again.

218
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,887
When you insult her, you insult our proud family.

219
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:47,931
What proud family?

220
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,309
You have the face of a mole.

221
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,394
What's there to be proud of?

222
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,188
A mole?

223
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,857
Did you just call her a mole?

224
00:13:57,274 --> 00:14:00,778
I planned on leaving peacefully today.

225
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:02,988
But now, you’ve said it.

226
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:06,158
You said the last thing
an Ice Devil wants to hear.

227
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,078
What? Just go home, will ya?

228
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:11,163
It's freezing in here!

229
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:16,085
Koji's a piece of cake, but her?
Forget about it.

230
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:19,671
What do I do?
Think of something quick!

231
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:21,882
There must be an effective way...

232
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,759
Oh, yeah!

233
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:26,136
What the hell is that?

234
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,847
Idiot! It's nothing!

235
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:32,893
You're done, Koji!
Face your back at me like that!

236
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:37,397
I'll pierce you with a dropkick
now enhanced with my abs of steel!

237
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:41,527
Killing you in front of your sister
will devastate her.

238
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,946
She'll be too unstable to fight.

239
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,365
And best of all, I'll win!

240
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:48,951
Let's not forget...!

241
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,964
Jeez, not again.

242
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:06,677
My abs of steel
were completely useless.

243
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,777
Do you think you can
let Jashin-chan go for today?

244
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:27,906
Sure. And I'm so glad my sister
got to see you, Yurine.

245
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:41,211
I got the slice to stand upright!
Hell, yeah!

246
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:43,964
It stands! It stands! It stands!

247
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,635
HELL BANK
JINBOCHO BRANCH

248
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,555
Here, I brought the money.

249
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,557
Can't you be discreet?

250
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,225
I don't want Yurine to know!

251
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,685
S-Sorry.

252
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:58,312
Too late now.

253
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,231
Sponging off Medusa again?

254
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,066
N-Not at all.

255
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,986
She's just paying me back.

256
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,946
You're the lowest of the low.

257
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:09,948
She knows.

258
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:13,785
I-I'm just borrowing it.

259
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,371
I always pay her back.

260
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:20,792
I paid her back the 40 yen
I borrowed 100 years ago.

261
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:24,463
That's the initial salary
of 100 years ago.

262
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:28,258
I don't really need her
to pay me back.

263
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:33,639
Right? It's best to assume the money
you lend will never come back.

264
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,225
You have no right to say that.

265
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:41,313
Medusa, you're spoiling her
a bit too much.

266
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,982
You're enabling her
to be a scumbag.

267
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,736
A scumbag? No, that's not good!

268
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:51,865
Right? So, you have to be responsible with her.

269
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,992
What, Medusa?

270
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,411
You're gonna listen to her?

271
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,707
You've known me for thousands
of years and yet, you choose Yurine?

272
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,209
U-Um...

273
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,461
You traitor!

274
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,755
Ah, here we go again.

275
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:10,259
I-It's not like that.
I'm just concerned for you.

276
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,468
Liar!

277
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:15,722
You just like yourself acting
like a goody two-shoes!

278
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,608
I hate you, Jashin-chan!

279
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,654
I don't care about you anymore.

280
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,573
I'm never coming back
to the human world again!

281
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,912
I don't need you!
Don't ever come back!

282
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:50,424
I said a bit too much.

283
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,385
Medusa...

284
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:58,265
Medusa hates me now.

285
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,685
Medusa was, to me...

286
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:05,105
She was my precious...

287
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,691
Precious...

288
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,695
-Personal ATM.
-I knew that was coming.

289
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:19,828
Say cheese!

290
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:25,292
I highly recommend
the cheesy pizza toast. It's tasty!

291
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:32,716
Can't go on without a drink!

292
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:36,553
She said she's never coming back.

293
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,682
Now I gotta make her send the money
via Hell-registered mail.

294
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:45,145
I don't need to see her face.

295
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:50,233
Another fresh strawberry juice
please!

296
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,903
You're drinking too much.

297
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,238
Leave me alone.

298
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:59,117
Having too much strawberry juice
won't kill me.

299
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,787
I'm not concerned about you.

300
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,374
We don't want to run out
for the other customers.

301
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,251
Oh.

302
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,926
I can't even get myself to walk.

303
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,605
This is so sad!

304
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,982
Medusa left me.

305
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:33,235
And nobody cares about me!

306
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:35,445
I...

307
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,948
I...

308
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:42,536
Did I do something that bad?
Maybe I did, but still!

309
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:47,958
Come on, can't you just love me
for who I am?

310
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:53,004
Come on! Just love me, please!

311
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,674
-Love me for who I am!
-What's wrong with you?

312
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:59,678
What's wrong with me?

313
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:01,138
Take me away.

314
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,014
I'm lonely!

315
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:05,475
Calm down, will ya?

316
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:06,977
Jashin-chan?

317
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,439
I'm hearing voices now.

318
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,232
I've lost my mind.

319
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,692
Jashin-chan.

320
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,485
Medusa's voice.

321
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:21,741
I didn't lose my mind.

322
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,536
I came to pick you up.

323
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:28,999
Y-You came back to me,
my ATM!

324
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,962
Medusa was so worried,
she came right back.

325
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,173
A... T...

326
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:40,302
It was all my fault
Forgive me, AT--

327
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,845
No, Medusa!

328
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:44,473
I know, Jashin-chan.

329
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:48,435
You can't function without me.

330
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,938
I love you, Medusa.

331
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:55,358
At... the... moment...

332
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:00,155
I love you at the moment, Medusa!

333
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,616
At the moment!

334
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:05,202
ATM!

335
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:13,126
ATM! ATM! ATM!

336
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:19,216
ATM! ATM! ATM!

337
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:25,555
Jashin-chan, aren't you hungry?

338
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,307
Let's get some curry.

339
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,018
What happened?

340
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:34,981
I'm completely broke because I had
100 glasses of strawberry juice.

341
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:40,862
Don't worry,
I'll take care of the bill.

342
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:46,535
I just can't live without you,
Medusa.

343
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,288
I love you, Medusa!

344
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:55,085
I'll never leave you again,
Jashin-chan.

345
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,797
-Medusa just enabled her to become
-Where should we go?

346
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,216
-the ultra-scumbag.
-Bondy, of course!

347
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,635
-Let's go!
-Yay!

348
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:04,928
SCUMBAG

349
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,348
-Medusa.
-Jashin-chan.

350
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,666
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

351
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:39,421
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

352
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,718
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

353
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,805
As she starves to death!

354
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:51,766
It’s a love and hate relationship,

355
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,144
can’t leave each other alone

356
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:58,815

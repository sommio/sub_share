1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,924
Minos.

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,801
What are you doing?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,720
Oh, hey, Yurine.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,556
I'm grilling lobsters.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,058
Ta-da!

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,812
I think those are crawfi--

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,605
When I told Jashin-chan

8
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,233
I wanted to try lobster...

9
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:27,987
Big catch at Shimizu Canal
around the corner!

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,030
And then she gave me all this!

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,240
A BUNCH

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,118
-Want some?
-No.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,703
-I'll grill some.
-No, thanks.

14
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,749
Looking good!

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,418
Let's try it.
Ouch! It's hot.

16
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,671
There. Let's eat!

17
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,633
Amazing! Nothing beats lobster!

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,010
100% BEEF

19
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,345
-Crawfish is good?
-Try some, Yurine!

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,014
-No, thanks.
-It's so crunchy.

21
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,603
Pretty darn good!

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,566
Won’t leave

23
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:11,363
without a dropkick on her!

24
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,536
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

25
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,510
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

26
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,054
-I gotta kill her or else
-What?

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,931
-I can’t go back to Hell!
-Sister...

28
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,643
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

29
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,561
If you go too far,

30
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,565
I’ll slice you up completely!

31
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,818
Your halo!
Must get it back!

32
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,947
-Never miss a chance
-Hey, seriously?

33
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:57,159
-To attack her from behind!
-You’re so mean.

34
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:01,413
I’ll never give up.

35
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,040
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

36
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:07,211
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

37
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,130
Huh? What? I missed…

38
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,551
Can’t leave Earth

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,681
without a dropkick on her!

40
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,851
But until then,

41
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:27,773
-let’s all have fun together!
-Yeah!

42
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,624
What about my present?

43
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,294
Of course I'll buy you one.

44
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,421
Really? Thanks!

45
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,840
That's right.

46
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,718
It's Christmas.

47
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,726
I'm so hungry.

48
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,230
It's Christmas.

49
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,275
And I'm having bread crust.

50
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,239
My Lord endured hardships too.

51
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,992
I should be grateful for the food I have!

52
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,751
-It's cold.
-So, what do you want for Christmas?

53
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,671
I want wealth, honor and status.

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,882
That's pretty mature of you.

55
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,843
I'm sure Santa will make it happen.

56
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,554
Then, I want love.

57
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,890
-Whoa, that's so cool.
-Right?

58
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,642
I want love.

59
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,685
So cool.

60
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:50,064
Santa? Must be talking about
Saint Nicholas.

61
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,107
He's got a lot on his plate.

62
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,527
How will he fulfill
these kids' wishes?

63
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,155
I wish for something
with bold flavor.

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,076
Why am I wishing
for a Christmas present

65
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,119
when I'm not even human!?

66
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,376
To begin with,
Christmas isn't even about presents!

67
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:17,174
Shoot, I'm choking!
I need something to drink!

68
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,261
MILK

69
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,805
That was close.

70
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,433
I almost drank it all.

71
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,311
This is all I have for today.

72
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,315
I'm grateful for the food I have.

73
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:39,071
But I'm craving something with more flavor.
Like curry.

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,367
Santa, will you visit an angel?

75
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,286
Delicious.

76
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,830
This smell...

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,082
So good.

78
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,085
-Curry?
-This curry is amazing.

79
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,338
Yurine Hanazono's familiar spirit.
Why is she here?

80
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,090
Wait, that hat.

81
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,635
-Is she Saint Nicholas' spirit?
-I got the take-out deal.

82
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,637
-So good!
-Was she sent for me?

83
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,351
-It was so good, I devoured it all.
-Nope.

84
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,104
I'll eat the second one too.

85
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,232
It smells wonderful!

86
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,735
Curry...

87
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,780
So juicy!

88
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,742
Juicy...

89
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,536
What are you staring at?

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,539
-None for you.
-I couldn't help it.

91
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,249
How embarrassing.

92
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,009
-I want that.
-Huh?

93
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,762
Give it to me.

94
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,599
You just had a feast.

95
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,809
This is all I have.

96
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,562
I finished my food, so give me that.

97
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,857
You glutton. You'll end up in Hell.

98
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,902
Funny. I'm from there.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,280
I don't care. I'm still hungry!

100
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,534
-Stop! This is all I have!
-Shut up! Give it to me!

101
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,873
M-My precious milk!

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,919
Your back's wide open!

103
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,254
Merry Christmas!

104
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,637
-Thanks.
-No!

105
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,557
Delicious! Stolen food
is out-of-this-world good.

106
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,644
It's a bit dry,
but delicious nonetheless.

107
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,896
H-How cruel.

108
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,066
You're the one who turned
your back on me.

109
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,443
And thanks for the compliment.

110
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,029
Give me back my precious food!

111
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,617
I'm not scared of you,
halo-less angel!

112
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,661
What the hell are you doing?

113
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,121
Ah! Yurine...

114
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,166
I told you to go home with the curry
while I got the chicken.

115
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,752
The witch, Yurine Hanazono.

116
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,881
-I don't know.
-Huh? What?

117
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,633
I don't know.

118
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,928
You ate the curry?

119
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,139
I-I don't know!

120
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,308
-Both of them?
-I don't know anything.

121
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,894
Where am I? Who am I?

122
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,314
I don't know.

123
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,942
-She ate it!
-What?

124
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,861
She's tiny, but she can eat.

125
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,780
-I told her no, but...
-Jashin-chan.

126
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,409
Why lie about it?

127
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,661
Fine, I ate it!

128
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,788
So?

129
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,424
Unbelievable.

130
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,430
-As punishment, no chicken for you.
-Oh come on...

131
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,267
T-Takoyaki... Blood...

132
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,353
-T-Takoyaki...
-Pekola.

133
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,858
Jashin-chan gave you a lot of trouble.

134
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,069
Please accept my apologies.

135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,071
This is Jashin-chan's chicken.

136
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,033
Food with bold flavor!

137
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,995
I-I can't accept anything
from a witch.

138
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,747
No way!

139
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,375
I'm still an angel, you know?

140
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,920
You could've poisoned it too.

141
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,174
This is an apology, accept it.

142
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,885
To eat it or not is your choice.

143
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,932
Jashin-chan, we're going home.

144
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:40,354
It's time to decorate our place.
Wanna be the tree?

145
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,448
Chicken! With bold flavors.

146
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,158
Yurine Hanazono.

147
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:58,080
-You're a witch, but my Santa!
-Why don't I gift your meat to Beth?

148
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,790
Please don't...

149
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,630
You like it, huh?
Eat as much as you want.

150
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,177
Jashin-chan, do you know?

151
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,431
Why Santa's outfit is red?

152
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,143
It's because it's stained in blood.

153
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,939
Merry Christmas.

154
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,318
Merry Christmas-sacre! Huh?

155
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,993
Jashin-chan, where are you?

156
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,579
Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...

157
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,209
-Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...
-She's hopeless on the streets.

158
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,964
-Jashin-chan... Jashin-chan...
-Will she ever find her?

159
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,175
I'm right here, getting crucified.

160
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,725
The seasons change
in a blink of an eye.

161
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,226
It's now deep autumn.

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,449
Done with training.

163
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,702
My own breathing method
is doing me great.

164
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,957
These abs will make my dropkick
more lethal.

165
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,252
Yurine, punch me in the stomach.

166
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,339
Test out these abs of steel.

167
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,590
All right.

168
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,846
Damn it.

169
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,307
Jashin-chan?

170
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,311
Coming!

171
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,484
Hello, my name is Yusa.

172
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,236
Thank you for taking care
of my sister.

173
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,739
Yusa? Um...

174
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,745
Enjoy.

175
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,538
Thank you.

176
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,249
I planned on eating this cake
all by myself!

177
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,876
REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS

178
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,630
Should've had it before my training!

179
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,304
Kori-chan saved us
during the summer.

180
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,478
But could you please stop the blizzard?
It's freezing.

181
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,355
Oh, of course.

182
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,194
I know you two are sisters,

183
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,905
but are you even the same organism?

184
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,657
Yes.

185
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,370
We, Ice Devils, change appearances
as we grow.

186
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,207
We're born with certain abilities
as a child.

187
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,877
But when we mature,
like I did,

188
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,673
we receive a name and become
a full-fledged devil.

189
00:11:54,881 --> 00:12:00,554
In human years, Ice Devils mature
at around 15 years old.

190
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,973
I see.

191
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,145
May I suggest Kori-chan's
future name?

192
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,771
How about Koji?

193
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,023
YUSA
KOJI

194
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,653
Isn't that a boy's name?

195
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,405
I guess so.

196
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,906
Koji?

197
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,701
So, what brings you here today?

198
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,788
Yes, we didn't mean to show up
unannounced,

199
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,250
but my sister begged me
to take her to see you.

200
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,419
We brought this for you.

201
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:39,426
-I heard she had fun with her.
-Damn it! Such a thin slice.

202
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,636
So, I wanted to thank her too.

203
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:50,270
Why the hell is she glaring
at me like she wants to kill me?

204
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,440
Is she actually here to kill me?

205
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,152
Mature Ice Devils
are high-class devils.

206
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,197
She could kill me in a second!

207
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,448
DEFEATIST WHEN FACING
STRONG DEVILS

208
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,659
Jashin-chan, did you do something?

209
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,417
She whistled in your ear
just to mess with you?

210
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,421
-You're only 95 yen.
-She stuck a bread-price tag on you?

211
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,090
Koji! You snitch!

212
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,718
You're such an idiot.

213
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,264
Now she's traumatized
with the sound of the whistle.

214
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,893
And she can't even step inside
a grocery store anymore.

215
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,228
That's ridiculous!

216
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:36,107
She's the low-class devil
who disobeyed me!

217
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,945
You insulted her again.

218
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,282
When you insult her, you insult our proud family.

219
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,285
What proud family?

220
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,704
You have the face of a mole.

221
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,748
What's there to be proud of?

222
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,583
A mole?

223
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,253
Did you just call her a mole?

224
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,173
I planned on leaving peacefully today.

225
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,384
But now, you’ve said it.

226
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,554
You said the last thing
an Ice Devil wants to hear.

227
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,473
What? Just go home, will ya?

228
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,517
It's freezing in here!

229
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,480
Koji's a piece of cake, but her?
Forget about it.

230
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,025
What do I do?
Think of something quick!

231
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,236
There must be an effective way...

232
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,154
Oh, yeah!

233
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,532
What the hell is that?

234
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,243
Idiot! It's nothing!

235
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,247
You're done, Koji!
Face your back at me like that!

236
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,793
I'll pierce you with a dropkick
now enhanced with my abs of steel!

237
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,922
Killing you in front of your sister
will devastate her.

238
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,300
She'll be too unstable to fight.

239
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,719
And best of all, I'll win!

240
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,305
Let's not forget...!

241
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,318
Jeez, not again.

242
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,072
My abs of steel
were completely useless.

243
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,173
Do you think you can
let Jashin-chan go for today?

244
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,302
Sure. And I'm so glad my sister
got to see you, Yurine.

245
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,565
I got the slice to stand upright!
Hell, yeah!

246
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,318
It stands! It stands! It stands!

247
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,031
HELL BANK
JINBOCHO BRANCH

248
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,950
Here, I brought the money.

249
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,952
Can't you be discreet?

250
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,579
I don't want Yurine to know!

251
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,039
S-Sorry.

252
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,666
Too late now.

253
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,585
Sponging off Medusa again?

254
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,462
N-Not at all.

255
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,382
She's just paying me back.

256
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,342
You're the lowest of the low.

257
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,344
She knows.

258
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,181
I-I'm just borrowing it.

259
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,725
I always pay her back.

260
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,146
I paid her back the 40 yen
I borrowed 100 years ago.

261
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,817
That's the initial salary
of 100 years ago.

262
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,654
I don't really need her
to pay me back.

263
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:33,034
Right? It's best to assume the money
you lend will never come back.

264
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,578
You have no right to say that.

265
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,667
Medusa, you're spoiling her
a bit too much.

266
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,336
You're enabling her
to be a scumbag.

267
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,090
A scumbag? No, that's not good!

268
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:51,219
Right? So, you have to be responsible with her.

269
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,346
What, Medusa?

270
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,765
You're gonna listen to her?

271
00:16:55,974 --> 00:17:00,103
You've known me for thousands
of years and yet, you choose Yurine?

272
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,604
U-Um...

273
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,815
You traitor!

274
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,109
Ah, here we go again.

275
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,654
I-It's not like that.
I'm just concerned for you.

276
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,864
Liar!

277
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:15,076
You just like yourself acting
like a goody two-shoes!

278
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,004
I hate you, Jashin-chan!

279
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,008
I don't care about you anymore.

280
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,927
I'm never coming back
to the human world again!

281
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,266
I don't need you!
Don't ever come back!

282
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,778
I said a bit too much.

283
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,781
Medusa...

284
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,660
Medusa hates me now.

285
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,080
Medusa was, to me...

286
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,501
She was my precious...

287
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,045
Precious...

288
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,049
-Personal ATM.
-I knew that was coming.

289
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,224
Say cheese!

290
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:24,646
I highly recommend
the cheesy pizza toast. It's tasty!

291
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,070
Can't go on without a drink!

292
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,907
She said she's never coming back.

293
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,036
Now I gotta make her send the money
via Hell-registered mail.

294
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:44,541
I don't need to see her face.

295
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,587
Another fresh strawberry juice
please!

296
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,257
You're drinking too much.

297
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,634
Leave me alone.

298
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,513
Having too much strawberry juice
won't kill me.

299
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,182
I'm not concerned about you.

300
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,727
We don't want to run out
for the other customers.

301
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,605
Oh.

302
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,321
I can't even get myself to walk.

303
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,001
This is so sad!

304
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,336
Medusa left me.

305
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,630
And nobody cares about me!

306
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,799
I...

307
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,343
I...

308
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,931
Did I do something that bad?
Maybe I did, but still!

309
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,353
Come on, can't you just love me
for who I am?

310
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:52,400
Come on! Just love me, please!

311
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,028
-Love me for who I am!
-What's wrong with you?

312
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:59,073
What's wrong with me?

313
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,533
Take me away.

314
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,410
I'm lonely!

315
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,871
Calm down, will ya?

316
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,372
Jashin-chan?

317
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,834
I'm hearing voices now.

318
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,586
I've lost my mind.

319
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,046
Jashin-chan.

320
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,881
Medusa's voice.

321
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,095
I didn't lose my mind.

322
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,932
I came to pick you up.

323
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:28,394
Y-You came back to me,
my ATM!

324
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:33,316
Medusa was so worried,
she came right back.

325
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,526
A... T...

326
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,656
It was all my fault
Forgive me, AT--

327
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,240
No, Medusa!

328
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,826
I know, Jashin-chan.

329
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,789
You can't function without me.

330
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,334
I love you, Medusa.

331
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,754
At... the... moment...

332
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,550
I love you at the moment, Medusa!

333
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,970
At the moment!

334
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,555
ATM!

335
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:12,522
ATM! ATM! ATM!

336
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:18,569
ATM! ATM! ATM!

337
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,909
Jashin-chan, aren't you hungry?

338
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,703
Let's get some curry.

339
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,414
What happened?

340
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:34,335
I'm completely broke because I had
100 glasses of strawberry juice.

341
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,216
Don't worry,
I'll take care of the bill.

342
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,888
I just can't live without you,
Medusa.

343
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,684
I love you, Medusa!

344
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,480
I'll never leave you again,
Jashin-chan.

345
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,192
-Medusa just enabled her to become
-Where should we go?

346
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,611
-the ultra-scumbag.
-Bondy, of course!

347
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,031
-Let's go!
-Yay!

348
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,323
SCUMBAG

349
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,744
-Medusa.
-Jashin-chan.

350
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,020
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

351
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,775
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

352
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,113
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

353
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:48,201
As she starves to death!

354
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,162
It’s a love and hate relationship,

355
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,498
can’t leave each other alone

356
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:58,169

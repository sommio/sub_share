1
00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:05,235
Won’t leave

2
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:11,032
without a dropkick on her!

3
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:17,163
Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas

4
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,136
-She summoned me, the evil god.
-Evil god!

5
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:34,722
I gotta kill her or else
What?

6
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,557
I can’t go back to Hell!
Sister...

7
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,311
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Life next to death, I combat with my chainsaw!

8
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,188
If you go too far,

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:46,234
I’ll slice you up completely!

10
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,486
Your halo!
Must get it back!

11
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:52,615
Never miss a chance
Hey, seriously?

12
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:56,786
To attack her from behind!
You’re so mean.

13
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:01,082
I’ll never give up.

14
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,667
Yurine, you’re off your guard!

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,838
Now!
Time to finish you with the Royal Copenhagen!

16
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:09,757
Huh? What? I missed…

17
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,177
Can’t leave Earth

18
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:18,308
without a dropkick on her!

19
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:21,477
But until then,

20
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:27,442
let’s all have fun together!
Yeah!

21
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:51,674
I'm dying!
The "summer" is too hot.

22
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,844
-Endure it.
-No can do.

23
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,601
-Endure--
-No can do!

24
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:06,481
-We are aliens and we come in peace.
-You're a devil.

25
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:11,736
Why don't you have one of those
wind machines in here?

26
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:16,032
An air conditioner?
We can't afford that.

27
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:20,036
I bet I could get Medusa
to buy us one.

28
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:24,332
Don't bother.
Just live with the fan.

29
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,377
This lukewarm air
is not gonna cut it!

30
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:40,014
We would have an air conditioner
if we weren't with Flex Comix.

31
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,265
Huh?

32
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:44,936
The bigger publishers
take good care of their talents.

33
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:52,735
I'm totally lost!

34
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,823
I'm out! Gonna go cool down
at an electronics shop in Akiba.

35
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:14,465
This...

36
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,175
is hell...

37
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,557
It's so hot!

38
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,559
And humid on top of that!

39
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,645
Discomfort index is 100,
no, more like 2020!

40
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:30,982
I can't believe they're hosting
the Olympics here.

41
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,233
It's such a scam.

42
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:36,446
"Omotenashi," my ass!

43
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:40,116
What's with the dissing?
You're gonna get roasted for that.

44
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:44,662
Shut up. I'll just give up, then.

45
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,583
Fine, I'll make it cooler for you.

46
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,585
Really?

47
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,473
W-What's this?

48
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:07,143
A punishment.
It's also much cooler now, right?

49
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,854
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

50
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,026
It's cooler all right...
It's freezing.

51
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:21,073
It's freezing... I'm so cold...

52
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,785
Well, that's good isn't it, Jashin-chan?

53
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,125
I won't stand for this!

54
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:35,588
Yurine, you're out of your mind.

55
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,965
Then don't act like a brat.

56
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:41,761
If it's come to this,
I better summon "it" from hell.

57
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,471
"It"?

58
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,395
Who is this?

59
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:54,023
Kori-chan, an Ice Devil.

60
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,025
Kori-chan?

61
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:58,986
Funny-looking face.

62
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,823
Kori-chan can cool a room
just by being there.

63
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,036
-Whoa, it really is cooler in here.
-And check this out!

64
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,001
Instant shaved ice.

65
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:15,378
Impressive.

66
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:17,505
So, which flavor?

67
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:18,756
Which?

68
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,676
Strawberry or lemon?

69
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,053
Then lemon--

70
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,305
Kori-chan's blood
is strawberry

71
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:29,517
-and her urine is lemon flavor!
-I'll take strawberry.

72
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,402
It really is strawberry syrup.

73
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:45,533
I eat hot foods in the summer
to intensify the heat!

74
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,661
Ah! It burns!

75
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,128
A cool room and shaved ice.
So convenient.

76
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:58,713
Very much so.

77
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,465
But it doesn't just end there.

78
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,176
Kori-chan, do that thing you do.

79
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,558
You don't want to right now?

80
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:13,853
Who do you think you are?

81
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:17,607
A low-class devil like you
must obey me.

82
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:21,068
Just do what I asked. Now!

83
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,864
Easy there, Jashin-chan.

84
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,873
-Snow...?
-Are you impressed or what?

85
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,753
Low-class devils only exist
to entertain us!

86
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,758
You must be honored
to serve a high-class devil like me.

87
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:52,642
The snow's getting heavy.

88
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:55,936
Kori-chan, you can stop now.

89
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:58,272
That's enough!

90
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,235
Stop right now, damn it!

91
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:08,407
Don't push your luck.
I'm done with you, so go home!

92
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:12,411
Jashin-chan, watch your mouth.
You're being cruel.

93
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,163
I am not!

94
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:17,124
This is what you get
for disobeying me!

95
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,627
Jashin-chan Cho--!

96
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,756
Let me explain.

97
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:28,177
Jashin-chan is relentless to smaller
and weaker low-class devils.

98
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,387
Chop!

99
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:33,557
Let go.

100
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,186
You froze me.

101
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,566
You stupid brat!

102
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,905
I’m glad you were able to cool off.

103
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,081
Can she regenerate?

104
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,669
How humiliating.

105
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,045
You deserved it.

106
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:05,089
WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED
"JASHIN-CHAN"

107
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:08,634
SUZURAN SHOPPING DISTRICT

108
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,901
I'm s-starving.

109
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:30,698
Angels are immortal, but...

110
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:34,535
humans are heartless.

111
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,788
It's obvious that I'm not okay.

112
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:43,794
My Lord.

113
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:47,214
Humans are completely corrupt now.

114
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,592
Final judgment day

115
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,136
might be coming in the near future.

116
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:07,485
An a-angel?

117
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,405
Pekola, are you okay?

118
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,616
The witch...

119
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:21,665
Enter Bondy from the back
of Kanda Used Bookstore.

120
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,168
Never enter from the bookstore.

121
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,881
The potato's tasty.

122
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:32,343
But, why do they serve potatoes
at a curry shop?

123
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,179
Eat or talk, just choose one.

124
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,349
Why do they serve potatoes?

125
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,975
Who knows?

126
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,687
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:53,614
Dig in, curry's best
when it's still hot.

128
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,115
Thank you.

129
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,911
Delicious.

130
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,167
May I have another serving?

131
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:08,754
Sure, I'll take it from
Jashin-chan's food budget.

132
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,422
One more, please!

133
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,132
Right away.

134
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:16,136
It's not angel-like of you
to wander around starving.

135
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:17,513
It's very human.

136
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,353
Without my halo,

137
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,356
I'm no different
than a feeble human.

138
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,859
With my halo,
I can work miracles.

139
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:34,238
Transforming rock into bread,
water into wine.

140
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:40,411
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.

141
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:46,375
Do you know if Jashin-chan
lives around here?

142
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,877
Jashin-chan?

143
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:51,338
I was sent by my mother from hell

144
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:55,175
to search for Jashin-chan.

145
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:57,386
JINBOCHO POLICE

146
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:00,806
Why don't you stay with us
for about three days?

147
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,225
Yeah, you're suspicious.

148
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,895
-But, Jashin-chan--
-Sure, sure.

149
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,647
Did you eat enough?

150
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,066
Yup, thank you so--

151
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:18,032
Thanking a witch
means I'm betraying God!

152
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:21,785
But, she treated me
and I even got seconds!

153
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:25,664
-I've been sinning all this time!
-May I have another serving?

154
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,666
You talk to yourself too much.

155
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,545
But it's true,
the witch saved my life.

156
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,048
Yurine Hanazono.

157
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,592
I've no choice but to thank you.

158
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:41,847
But, I still haven't given up
on eliminating you and the devils.

159
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:46,685
Just wait. When I find my halo,
and get my powers back,

160
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,771
I'll eliminate you all!

161
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,986
I hope you find your halo soon.

162
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,865
Idiot, weren't you listening
to what I just said?

163
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:03,494
I get so confused when I'm with you.
I'm going home!

164
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,914
Bless her heart.

165
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,584
My Lord, what should I do?

166
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:13,379
Should I consider her my neighbor,

167
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,255
even though she’s a witch?

168
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:18,884
This world is full
of contradictions!

169
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:26,725
My Lord,
why did they serve potatoes?

170
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,939
Jashin-chan?

171
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:33,065
100% BEEF

172
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,775
We're here!

173
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,236
Jashin-chan?

174
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,364
She invited us
and she's not even here.

175
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,157
Maybe...

176
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,575
She's in here.

177
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,286
Nope.

178
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:49,373
I usually find her hiding
in here.

179
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,085
I'm right here!

180
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,213
Trumped you there!

181
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,965
Medusa's like,

182
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:00,676
"I usually find her hiding
in here."

183
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:01,844
Dumbass!

184
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:05,848
Why would I hide in the same place
over and over again? Idiot.

185
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:09,101
I-I'll check under the floors
next time.

186
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,812
But, why were you hiding at all?

187
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,815
Good question! Let me tell you...

188
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,195
I know! You were testing to see
if it was a good place to hide

189
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:24,241
for when you go for
a surprise attack on Yurine!

190
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,201
Oh?

191
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:28,954
How'd you know?

192
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,624
Save yourself the effort.
You'll fail again.

193
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,918
-Hey, Minos.
-Yeah?

194
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,755
Convince her to give up
on killing Yurine.

195
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,466
No! I'll never give up!

196
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,844
Off you go. The experiment's over.

197
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,262
Out you go.

198
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,435
Any minute now...

199
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,023
I'm back.

200
00:13:56,398 --> 00:14:01,236
I'm hungry. The trident was on sale
today for half off so I bought it.

201
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,573
-Looks like she's not even here.
-What? A trident?

202
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:05,866
There!

203
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,912
That's a good place
to store it for now.

204
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:13,332
Why would you stab
a trident through the floor?

205
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,003
She seems clueless.

206
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:19,755
But who knows.

207
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:22,841
She might already know
I'm in here.

208
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:26,053
Let me check.

209
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,935
All right. She really doesn't know.

210
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:36,271
I'll throw this at her
just for fun.

211
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:37,981
Ouch.

212
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,736
An avocado...?

213
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:44,363
I'll eat it later.

214
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,115
She's clueless!

215
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,784
She's gonna eat it later?
What an idiot.

216
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:52,746
At this rate,
I could probably go for it...

217
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:56,792
I'll sneak up behind her
and use this.

218
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,128
This is the end.

219
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,046
Goodbye, Yurine!

220
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:07,678
YURINE

221
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,235
H-Hey there.

222
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,157
I see what's going on.

223
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:34,246
I didn't expect to be able to test out
the trident so soon.

224
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:38,083
T-Trident happy?

225
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:47,426
Let's "try."

226
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:50,804
Well, I knew that was coming.

227
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,348
I did my part, I warned her.

228
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:01,565
What is that?

229
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:05,152
A tomahawk, it was 80 percent off
at the weapon shop.

230
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,333
Hello, Jashin-chan?

231
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,543
Medusa? Come here now!

232
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:24,046
-W-Why?
-I'll tell you later!

233
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:26,506
Jashin-chan?

234
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,842
Excuse me!

235
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:30,802
Your voice is adorable!

236
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,055
You sound exactly like Miyutan!

237
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:34,932
What's with this bag?

238
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:36,642
N-No! Not my face!

239
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,394
Don't worry! With a cute voice
like yours,

240
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:42,898
you'll look cute
even if you're not all that!

241
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,534
That's why I told you to stop.

242
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:58,163
I gotta get to Jashin-chan now!

243
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,376
Here you go.

244
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,336
Thank you.

245
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,672
Tokyo's a dense city.

246
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,675
I wouldn't worry about
fossilizing one guy.

247
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:15,013
Anyway, why isn't she here
when she invited you?

248
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:17,307
Jashin-chan has no respect.

249
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:19,685
I'm pretty used to it.

250
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:22,938
Delicious.

251
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,815
What do you mean?

252
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:27,317
Does she always treat
you this bad?

253
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,862
What? Oh no, not really.

254
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:35,075
Really?
So, was she always like this?

255
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,328
Well, let's see...

256
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:41,498
When we attended Hell Elementary...

257
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,334
Jashin-chan acted out

258
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,296
and knocked down a statue
in the courtyard.

259
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:50,757
Who broke the gargoyle statue?

260
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,136
She hasn't changed a bit.

261
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:59,266
But, when Jashin-chan was bullying
a weak devil...

262
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,186
Dumb goblin, you can't
score higher than me!

263
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:04,646
Stop it, Jashin-chan!

264
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,898
You're dumb and stupid!

265
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:10,485
What did my son do to you?

266
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:13,613
I said no, but Medusa forced me!

267
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:14,865
No, I didn't!

268
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:16,908
Good times.

269
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,076
What part?

270
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:22,497
Oh, yeah, when she fell in a trap...

271
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,126
All right.

272
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:31,131
-See ya!
-Wait! Don't leave me in here!

273
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:34,843
They finally found me
after three days.

274
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,303
Another time...

275
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:41,016
-Do anything to her but let me go.
-No!

276
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:43,352
Those were the days.

277
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,645
-Another time!
-Enough.

278
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:47,731
You've gone through too much.

279
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,232
Really?

280
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,901
I guess as devils,

281
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:54,154
it doesn't matter if you're mean
and cunning.

282
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:56,948
Hey there! I'm a meanie!

283
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:01,161
Why are you still her friend
even though she betrays you all the time?

284
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:03,121
Are you an "M"?

285
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,836
In any case, Jashin-chan's
still trash.

286
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:12,923
Actually, she can be pretty cute
at times.

287
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,635
Whenever she's in trouble,

288
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:19,554
she relies on me the most!

289
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:23,767
UNDERWORLD

290
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:28,563
It's just a devilish perspective!

291
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:29,773
Damn it!

292
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:35,237
Medusa!

293
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:38,698
Wait for me!

294
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,326
Don't abandon me!

295
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:44,955
You're the only one
I could count on!

296
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,792
Forgive me for everything
I've done to you.

297
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:53,839
I know you like me, Medusa!

298
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:03,932
When I see her so vulnerable...

299
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:06,893
She makes me think

300
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:11,398
she can't live without me,
that I need to be there for her.

301
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:19,823
Careful, don't let any losers
take advantage of you.

302
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,951
O-Okay, I'll be careful.

303
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:25,036
I'm back!

304
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:26,455
She's home.

305
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:30,208
Don't go out when you invite
Medusa over.

306
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,835
She doesn't mind.

307
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,755
Medusa's lower in class
so I make her wait.

308
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,593
Welcome back, Jashin-chan.
Why did you call me?

309
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,428
This is all the money I have.

310
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:42,721
10,000 YEN

311
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:46,475
-Idiot! Not in front of Yurine.
-S-Sorry.

312
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,853
I never asked you for money.

313
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:54,065
But, if you say so,
I'll happily accept the cash.

314
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,985
Then what did you want me for?

315
00:20:57,277 --> 00:21:00,238
If it's illegal in hell,

316
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,115
I can't help you.

317
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,744
We'll handle that later.
I called you for this today.

318
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:09,372
I won you this at an arcade
in Ikebukuro.

319
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:12,584
You said it was cute last time.

320
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,505
The panda human doll.

321
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,467
Jashin-chan, you remembered!

322
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,471
I won it using your money, Medusa.

323
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:25,805
Here you go.

324
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,477
Thanks so much, Jashin-chan!

325
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:37,359
Don't hug me!
Who do you think you are?

326
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:41,488
I only did it
because it benefits me.

327
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:44,366
It means nothing more than that.

328
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:47,953
But, I'm still happy!

329
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,497
Stop it! Don't hug me!

330
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,253
It looks like a happy ending.

331
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:58,046
But, it's all doomed.

332
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,048
This looks familiar.

333
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:01,758
Medusa!

334
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:05,095
I've seen this before.

335
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:34,624
Dropkick on her! Yeah her!
I’ll take you down again!

336
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:39,337
Hate you!
Love doesn’t exist in this world

337
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:44,676
Fear the dropkick!
An Angel looks for her halo

338
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:48,805
As she starves to death!

339
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,725
It’s a love and hate relationship,

340
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,102
can’t leave each other alone

341
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,773
Like a galaxy-bursting shooting star!

342
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:02,986
Slowly, slowly, sneak up and DIE!

343
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,196
Test my heart, don’t stop

344
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:12,454
Let’s go! Dream on! No matter human, angel or devil

345
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:16,666
We’re a happy family La la la

346
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,962
Let me say, I love you!!

347
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,256
When all is said and done

348
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:28,094
I’m home! Welcome back, it’s hot pot tonight!

349
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:32,766
Come, gather everyone! Let’s enjoy this meal!

350
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:34,976
For another crazy tomorrow

351
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,605
What next? What next? In the end, Wakeup!

352
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,903
Winter has come.
The streets are filled with Christmas spirit.

353
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:49,575
Away from the bustle of the city,
a poor girl cries.

354
